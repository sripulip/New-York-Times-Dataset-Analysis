[Page C1.] HOT ON GOOGLE'S HEELS -- Even as Google continues to outmaneuver its main search rivals, Yahoo and Microsoft, plenty of newcomers are trying to beat the company at its own game. Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. [C1.] DO-IT-YOURSELF SEARCH ENGINE -- The voluntary collaborative ''wiki'' model, which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is being recruited to build a better search engine. [C5.] STRUGGLES FOR SATELLITE RADIO -- Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map. But stock of Sirius and its larger rival, XM Satellite Radio, have taken a battering from Wall Street, with share prices for both off about 50 percent from their year-ago levels.

A6 NATIONAL A8-16 Democrats to Propose New Ethics Rules The Democrats taking over Congress are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rule.

Officials are now grappling with how to scale down downtown. A15 Higher Pay Sought for Judiciary Chief Justice John G.

The Central Park Conservancy renewed its plan for a $7 million restoration after getting a $3.5 million gift from the estate of Evelyn West in 2002. The arcade, originally completed in the 1860s, is expected to reopen in late January. HAEYOUN PARK AND GRAHAM ROBERTS Tile Restoration CLEANING AND REPAIRING Conservators have spent the last two years cleaning all 15,876 tiles, reattaching broken segments and repainting the tiles to match their original colors. REPLACING DAMAGE About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair. New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent, England, for $250 to $270 each. REINSTALLING TILE PANELS The 49 panels alternate between two patterns. Three panels, consisting only of brand new tiles, will be placed in one of the two side loggias. New Layers Of Support UPPER TERRACE A new waterproof membrane will catch water leaking through the pavement and redirect it to a subsurface drain before it reaches the ceiling tiles. STEEL SUPPORTS Brick arches have been replaced by steel beams, which, together with the existing wrought iron girders, will act as the primary support for the road above. CAST IRON RIBS The ornamental cast iron framework was painted a shade of gold with mica powder for extra sheen, accented by blue and reddish brown. Not much is known about the framework's historic colors other than that they were ''richly gilded.'' TILE PANELS Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar, then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit. Each panel has 324 encaustic, or inlaid, tiles. They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded, not just a surface glaze.

The number was up from 97,296 in 2002, the last time the department divulged 12 months worth of data. A1 A Groundhog's Prediction Groundhog Day has been part of the Western calendar since around the 5th century A.D. But whether it will survive in an age of global warming was one question raised by the coincidence of Groundhog Day 2007 falling on the same day a report was released saying that global warming was an ''unequivocal'' fact likely to keep summers hotter and winters warmer.

By Mireille Marokvia. (Unbridled, $24.95.) Marokvia is no Sophie Scholl, the Munich student who was beheaded in 1943 for distributing antigovernment fliers, though they seemed to feel the same way about Hitler. The French-born Marokvia was married to an ambitious German artist -- ''handsome, built like a ballet dancer, chic in pants on which he wiped his paintbrushes.'' When she presents her ''best po\u00e8me en prose,'' he admonishes her, ''Write a sonnet!'' He works as a government-sponsored artist-reporter, painting mines, barracks and soldiers, and she lives quietly in a mill near the Swiss-German border. Her memoir describes what it's like to hate the Nazis -- as she and her husband did -- but to protest unheroically: making a snide comment when a building super rants against ''unpatriotic people''; not finding humor in a party member's joke; walking out of a movie in which a Jewish prime minister is executed (''the audience burst into applause''). In December 1941, Marokvia, the author of a previous memoir called ''Immortelles,'' studies weaving in an art school as ''the Jews of Stuttgart'' board buses and are put on a train ''that never arrived anywhere,'' in the words of a local lawyer. She may have lacked moral courage, but she has literary talent, conveying the everyday horror of Nazi Germany. Eventually, a police chief accuses her of being a spy and tracks her movements -- until a Berlin acquaintance intervenes. ''Why didn't you kill Hitler?'' her husband's Parisian friends ask after the war. In this book, we can all discover the reason. VICE: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency. By Lou Dubose and Jake Bernstein. (Random House, $24.95.) If you think Dick Cheney exists in ''a parallel radical-right fantasyland''; if you believe that his chief of staff, David S. Addington, is an ''attack dog''; and if you consider Robert Novak ''the dark doyen of conservative journalism,'' you may find yourself high-fiving Dubose and Bernstein as you read ''Vice.'' Dubose, the co-author (with Molly Ivins) of ''Bushwhacked,'' and Bernstein, the executive editor of The Texas Observer, devote chapters to Cheney's Halliburton stint (''Lawless C.E.O.''), family life (''Lady MacCheney'') and recent achievements (''The Torture Presidency''). They also describe his feelings about the Freedom of Information Act and presidential power (you can probably guess). Despite having little access to Cheney and his colleagues, the authors capture the vice president's interiority with surprising certainty (''Cheney didn't want a normal life; he wanted to live, eat and breathe the White House''). Google, disgruntled civil servants, an ex-Grateful Dead lyricist and Ron Suskind's ''Price of Loyalty'' appear to be their sources. Dubose and Bernstein, who use the word ''cabal'' at least 10 times, seem aghast at Washington behavior, saying, for example, that the former State Department official Elliott Abrams ''apparently had no qualms about misleading legislators and the American people.'' This brings to mind a story that made the rounds in early-1990s Poland. At a briefing under martial law, a journalist supposedly asked the government spokesman Jerzy Urban if he was telling the truth. ''Is this the first time you've ever been to a press conference?'' was his reply. WHAT WAS ASKED OF US: An Oral History of the Iraq War by the Soldiers Who Fought It. By Trish Wood. (Little, Brown, $25.99.) During a March 2003 battle in Nasiriya, an ''almost incoherent'' gunnery sergeant ran up to another soldier: ''All he kept saying is 'Did you see what happened to us?' '' the soldier recalls. ''And then we started hearing the stories.'' In this book, dozens of war veterans tell their own stories of ''madness and chaos'' in Iraq. Dismemberment is a unifying theme: ''the severed leg of a marine''; a girl's foot, ''burned and smoldered,'' in a pink sandal; ''a dog running through the city with a femur in its mouth.'' Improvised explosive devices, a surgeon explains, have ushered in ''a whole new era of warfare,'' creating burn victims, amputees and quadriplegics. ''It reminds me of 'Johnny Got His Gun,' '' the surgeon tells Wood, an investigative reporter. The author's oral history seems polemically edited, consisting almost entirely of battle carnage, with a swipe at S.U.V.'s and Wal-Mart. Yet it offers a visceral account of the war, showing what it's like to know how ''bodies look when they're burnt up from bombs'' (like ''meat on the grill''); to smell blood (''It has this copper kind of iron smell''); and to watch ''a pink cloud'' rising from a blown-out building full of bodies. The firsthand accounts are honest, agenda-free and chilling. ON HER TRAIL: My Mother, Nancy Dickerson, TV News' First Woman Star. By John Dickerson. (Simon & Schuster, $24.95.) As the first woman news correspondent for CBS Television, Nancy Dickerson interviewed Lyndon B. Johnson shortly after he became a vice-presidential candidate at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. ''Goddamn good news reporting, ma'am,'' Edward R. Murrow told her off camera. A Jackie Kennedy-style beauty, Dickerson also dated John F. Kennedy (before he was married); hung out with Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra and Truman Capote; and, with her tycoon husband, raised five children in a McLean, Va., mansion. By 1970, she was ''the second-highest-paid correspondent'' on NBC. It was a glamorous life, mercilessly skewered in this sharp-as-a-serpent's-tooth memoir/biography. John Dickerson, Slate's chief political correspondent, chronicles his mother's lackluster cooking, ''clumsy'' tennis game, and rumored and actual affairs. He also includes mean things people said (''What did she have to do in the barn to get that tractor?'' a sound man joked when she borrowed one for a news segment). Indeed, it's an inverted story of child abuse. Dickerson describes how he and his brother tormented their mother: ''My 18-year-old brother held her over the balcony,'' he writes. ''If he'd let go she would have dropped into the front hall. We were laughing. She was terrified.'' Yet Nancy Dickerson, who died in 1997, was a ''steel magnolia,'' according to an NBC director, and, as Diane Sawyer says, ''hard-wired for courtesy.'' She remains legendary -- despite her son's disjointed, sketchy book. THE MIDDLE SEA: A History of the Mediterranean. By John Julius Norwich. (Doubleday, $39.95.) Norwich, the author of ''Byzantium'' and ''A History of Venice,'' starts his book about the Mediterranean on a promising note: ''I decided to begin, not with rocks and water, but with people.'' He tells us about a series of colorful kings, including William the Bad, ''a huge ogre of a man''; his son William the Good, a Norman king; Selim the Sot, who died in 1574 ''after consuming a whole bottle of strong Cyprus wine at a single draft and then slipping on the wet floor of the baths''; and (my favorite) a ninth-century monarch, Charles the Fat. Norwich hands out regal report cards, saying William the Good, for example, was ''weak and ineffectual.'' He also covers important milestones like the Crusades, piracy and gladiatorial contests. Too bad the book lacks cohesion, original thought and passion. For 600 pages, Norwich takes us on a pleasure-free cruise, offering up potted histories (''They mistrusted all things military,'' he writes about the Minoans. ''They made love, not war''); recycled Thucydides; and tourist tips, describing 18th-century inns that were ''verminous and foul-smelling.'' Finally, Norwich says dismissively, today's Mediterranean, clogged with Jet Skis and yacht marinas, has turned into ''a playground.'' Not an epithet one would hurl at this book.", "headline": {"main": "Nonfiction Chronicle"}, "abstract": "Tara McKelvey Nonfiction Chronicle article notes books Sins of the Innocent: A Memoir by Mireille Marokvia, Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency by Lou Dubose and Jake Bernstein, What Was Asked of Us: An Oral History of the Iraq War by the Soldiers Who Fought It by Trish Wood, On Her Trail: My Mother, Nancy Dickerson, TV News' First Woman Star by John Dickerson and The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean by John Julius Norwich; photo from book Worldchanging: A User's Guide to the 21st Century edited by Alex Steffen with Foreword by Al Gore (M)", "print_page": "17", "word_count": 1242, "_id": "4fd28e288eb7c8105d863fe0", "snippet": "New books by Mireille Marokvia, Lou Dubose and Jake Bernstein, Trish Wood, John Dickerson and John Julius Norwich.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/books/review/McKelvey.t.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2007/02/04/books/mcke450.jpg", "height": 450, "width": 585, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 585, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2007/02/04/books/mcke450.jpg", "xlargeheight": 450}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "VICE (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "SINS OF THE INNOCENT: A MEMOIR (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "WHAT WAS ASKED OF US (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "ON HER TRAIL (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "WORLDCHANGING: A USER'S GUIDE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "MIDDLE SEA, THE: A HISTORY OF THE MEDITERRANEAN (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WOOD, TRISH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DICKERSON, JOHN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BERNSTEIN, JAKE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DUBOSE, LOU"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NORWICH, JOHN JULIUS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MAROKVIA, MIREILLE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STEFFEN, ALEX"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DICKERSON, NANCY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GORE, AL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CHENEY, DICK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Tara", "lastname": "MCKELVEY"}], "original": "By TARA MCKELVEY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-02-04T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Automobiles", "lead_paragraph": "GETTING driving directions is an easy process these days with computer software, mapping Web sites and G.P.S. systems.

[C1.] AN UNLIKELY INTERNET STAR -- Shmuel Tennenhaus, an aspiring comedy writer who gained a modest following on YouTube for his droll question-and-answer clips and other spots featuring his grandmother ''Bubby,'' is being wooed by the site's competitors with promises of guaranteed exposure, a share of advertising money, or both. [C1.] A LITTLE HELP FROM HER FRIENDS -- Tila Tequila, left, a onetime model for Playboy.com who was born Tila Nguyen, became famous last year for having the most friends on MySpace.com.

Premium traffic on Europe to Asia routes and all routes to the Middle East continued to grow in double digits, said the group, which represents 250 world airlines.

RENOVATIONS IN LOS ANGELES -- There was a groundbreaking ceremony at Los Angeles International Airport yesterday for a $575.6 million renovation of the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Officials said the renovation to the 1 million-square-foot terminal was needed to help the airport compete with airports like San Francisco International as demand surges for trans-Pacific travel. Some ticket and check-in counters and screening gates will be relocated during the three-year project, but airport officials said that they expected there would be no disruptions in flight operations. When the renovations are complete, airport officials said, four new megalounges will replace the 16 individual airline lounges and significantly expand overall lounge space by 72 percent, to 47,000 square feet. Three of the new lounges will serve airline alliances, and the fourth will serve unaffiliated airlines. ET CETERA -- About $10 billion a year is spent by 12- to 18-year-olds traveling without their parents, usually on a school or other group trip, but sometimes traveling independently, according to a new survey by the Student and Youth Travel Research Institute at Michigan State University. Thanks to booming travel demand, the two major manufacturers of commercial airliners, Boeing and Airbus, are ''sitting on enormous production backlogs,'' said the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation. Airbus currently has 2,533 outstanding orders, and Boeing has 2,434. ''And production lines for many models are essentially sold out for the next two or three years,'' the trade group said.

Viacom said it was seeking more than $1 billion in damages.

[C1.] IMPACT OF SUBPRIME TURMOIL Mutual funds held mortgage-related debt securities issued by subprime lenders New Century Financial, Novastar Financial and others at the end of last year, indicating that everyday investors are among those who will likely be hurt by the turmoil that is tearing through the residential mortgage market.

[C3.] ADMINISTRATION'S NEW ATTITUDE Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. suggested that the administration was considering a more business-friendly approach, a response to criticism that post-Enron rule changes had gone too far. [C3.] LEHMAN INVESTS IN HEDGE FUND Lehman Brothers, bought a 20 percent stake in the management companies of D. E. Shaw, a $29 billion hedge fund. The acquisition continued Lehman's strategy of buying stakes in hedge funds to gain exposure to the fast-growing alternative asset arena. For David Shaw, above, who has watched his company grow from $28 million in 1988 to $29 billion today, the deal was probably a way to diversify his wealth.

The company will build the mill, scheduled to open in 2010, in Mount Vernon. The site was chosen because of its ''cost efficiency'' and ''site specific capital expenditures,'' ThyssenKrupp said. The company picked Alabama over Louisiana, which spent $3 million over 15 months trying to lure the plant, but could not compete with the financial incentives offered by Alabama, said Michael Olivier, Louisiana's secretary for economic development. Alabama allocated $900 million of tax-exempt debt authorized by Congress after Hurricane Katrina to help economies in areas hit by the storm, and another $400 million of bonds to help with infrastructure costs. The state also approved 20-year breaks on state and local property taxes and a 30-year period in which to apply tax credits on the plant's income to recover capital costs. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) HOME BUILDER SELLS UNIT -- The home builder KB Home said an unidentified bidder offered $783.2 million, or $71.85 a share, for its stake in a French subsidiary, Kaufman & Broad. KB Home, which is based in Los Angeles, owns 10.9 million shares in the subsidiary, which accounted for $378.4 million, or 21.4 percent, of KB Home's first-quarter revenue. KB Home said it was evaluating the offer. It is also looking at other strategic alternatives, including a public or private offering of its shares in the division or keeping the stake, equal to 49 percent of voting securities in Kaufman. EX-CHIEF OF HBO PLEADS -- The former chief executive of HBO, Chris Albrecht, settled a criminal domestic violence charge in Las Vegas, when his lawyer pleaded no contest on his behalf to battery and agreed to pay a $1,000 fine, authorities said. Mr. Albrecht, left, lost his job after he was arrested early Sunday outside the MGM Grand Hotel, where police reported seeing him ''grabbing a white female by the throat with both hands.'' Mr. Albrecht's girlfriend, Karla Jensen, declined medical treatment and told police she did not want to press charges. Mr. Albrecht, 54, and Ms. Jensen, 37, issued statements through a publicist in New York saying both were to blame for what Ms. Jensen characterized as a mistake. They said they intended to remain together. PROFIT IS DOWN AT FORTIS -- Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch bank and insurance company that is part of a consortium trying to buy ABN Amro, said its first-quarter profit fell 12 percent on a decline in its banking division. Fortis reported earnings of 1.17 billion euros ($1.58 billion), down from 1.33 billion euros a year earlier. It said profit at its banking arm fell 13 percent, to 903 million euros ($1.22 billion), largely from a one-time gain of 120 million euros in the first quarter of 2006 after reassessing the value of an investment. Insurance profit rose 4 percent, to 352 million euros ($477 million), reflecting strong gains in Fortis's life insurance business, which offset 86 million euros ($117 million) in damage claims after a major storm hit northern Europe in January. Fortis shares fell 1.7 percent, to 32.73 euros ($44.26), in Amsterdam. The bank and its partners in the consortium are trying to outbid a friendly offer for ABN Amro from Barclays. TOTAL TO SELL STAKE -- Total plans to sell its 13 percent stake in the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, the French oil company's chief executive told shareholders. Total is one of Sanofi-Aventis' largest shareholders, with a stake worth 12 billion euros ($16.18 billion). Christophe de Margerie, Total's chief executive, said it would sell its stake ''probably in the short term.'' He made the comment at Total's annual shareholders meeting in Paris. Speculation of a sale of the Total stake has swirled for weeks. Sanofi-Aventis earnings for the first quarter fell 17 percent, suffering from lingering integration costs arising from the 2004 merger between Sanofi-Synthelabo and Aventis. NOKIA'S BIGGEST ORDER -- Nokia, the world's biggest mobile phone maker, unveiled the largest order in its history, to supply handsets in China in a deal worth $2.5 billion. The order from China Postel, China's largest mobile phone wholesaler, could represent more than 20 million phones, analysts said. Nokia, which sells more than a third of all mobile phones across the world, has a strong position in emerging markets like China, thanks in part to its efficient distribution system. Nokia's lead on the global market over its closest rival, Motorola, grew to its widest in years in the beginning of 2007 as the Finnish company benefits from its early entry into fast-growing emerging markets. And with Motorola's decision at the start of 2007 to back away from the tightest competition in the low-end segment, Nokia has few rivals there. (REUTERS) TRIAL ON GOOGLE AD SYSTEM -- A federal judge ordered Google to face a jury trial in a trademark infringement suit that aims at the workings of the company's main source of revenue. In the lawsuit, American Blind and Wallpaper Factory charges that Google abuses trademarks by allowing rivals of a company to buy ads that appear when consumers search for information on that company. David Rammelt, the lead lawyer for American Blinds, said Federal District Judge Jeremy Fogel of the Northern District of California had set Nov. 9 for jury selection. AdWords is the popular online system which serves up ads tied to searches users perform on Google or Google-affiliated sites. The program accounted for 98 percent or more of the company's $10.6 billion in revenue last year. (REUTERS) PROVIDENCE EQUITY BUYS USIS -- Providence Equity Partners, a buyout firm focused on media and communications, has agreed to acquire USIS, an employee-screening company, from two other investment firms for $1.5 billion, USIS said in a statement. The sellers are Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe and the Carlyle Group, USIS said. The two firms bought USIS in 2003 in a transaction valued at $717 million. Lehman Brothers is the financial adviser for USIS, based in Falls Church, Va., and is providing financing for the acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter. Providence Equity, based in Providence, R.I., manages about $21 billion in equity funds.

Coulton is 36 and shaggily handsome. In September 2005, he quit his job as a computer programmer and, with his wife's guarded blessing, became a full-time singer and songwriter. He set a quixotic goal for himself: for the next year, he would write and record a song each week, posting each one to his blog. ''It was a sort of forced-march approach to creativity,'' he admitted to me over the sound of the cafe's cappuccino frothers. He'd always wanted to be a full-time musician, and he figured the only way to prove to himself he could do it was with a drastic challenge. ''I learned that it is possible to squeeze a song out of just about anything,'' he said. ''But it's not always an easy or pleasant process.'' Given the self-imposed time constraints, the ''Thing a Week'' songs are remarkably good. Coulton tends toward geeky, witty pop tunes: one song, ''Tom Cruise Crazy,'' is a sympathetic ode to the fame-addled star, while ''Code Monkey'' is a rocking anthem about dead-end programming jobs. By the middle of last year, his project had attracted a sizable audience. More than 3,000 people, on average, were visiting his site every day, and his most popular songs were being downloaded as many as 500,000 times; he was making what he described as ''a reasonable middle-class living'' -- between $3,000 and $5,000 a month -- by selling CDs and digital downloads of his work on iTunes and on his own site.", "headline": {"main": "-Sex, Drugs And Updating Your Blog-"}, "abstract": "Clive Thompson article on singer and songwriter Jonathan Coulton, who has set goal of writing song every week and posting it to his blog; he has close, even symbiotic, relationship with his fans, who promote his work worldwide through YouTube music videos they have created and other online tools; he maintains online relationship with fans, responding to enormous amounts of e-mail; Coulton is emblematic of today's performing artists, particularly new or struggling musicians, who are eager to master social rules of Internet fame; photo (L)", "print_page": "42", "word_count": 5003, "_id": "4fd25d068eb7c8105d80af85", "snippet": "How the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll life became a desk job.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/magazine/13audience-t.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2007/05/13/magazine/13blog75.1.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2007/05/13/magazine/13blog75.1.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "COULTON, JONATHAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "OK GO"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YOUTUBE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MYSPACE.COM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YOUTUBE.COM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ITUNES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOLD STEADY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROCK MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTRONIC MAIL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (VIDEO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLOGS AND BLOGGING (INTERNET)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (AUDIO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Clive", "lastname": "Thompson"}], "original": "By Clive Thompson"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-05-13T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 5, "offset": 0, "time": 42}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

To lure talent, these companies have expanded their recruiting arsenal far beyond the traditional job fair to include events like technology lectures, cocktail parties, pizza parties, treasure hunts and programming contests, called ''code jams'' or ''hack days.'' [Page C1.] LOOKING FOR STARS Despite being the first and certainly the largest African-American cable channel, Black Entertainment Television has developed few of its own marketable stars and virtually no breakout programs. It relies on reruns, movies and music videos for the bulk of its lineup. The chief executive of BET, Debra L. Lee, has tried to reverse that trend, this year increasing the channel's production budget 50 percent and plunging into original programming with 16 new shows for the fall. [C1.] POLICEMAN, NOT A REPORTER David Cunningham, a prominent protester who heads the Anti-Poverty Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia, recently received a call from someone who said he was a reporter named Peter MacKay from the free daily tabloid 24 Hours Vancouver. But when Mr. Cunningham arrived outside a shopping mall for what he thought would be an interview, Peter MacKay turned out to be a plainclothes police officer who arrested him. Someone in the Vancouver Police Department thought the deception was a clever way to lure Mr. Cunningham, but the ruse provoked widespread criticism from civil rights and journalism groups. [C4.] HIGH ASPIRATIONS Though far from a household name in telecommunications, Altimo, the Russian telecommunications investment company, has aspirations of becoming a global power. But the problem it faces, some analysts say, is that at this point, Altimo has made few allies. If it is known beyond Russia at all, it is for its propensity to fight tenaciously in court and on corporate boards for its ambitions, some say. [C5.] THE MALE DIETER The face of dieting may be changing. Of the 72 million people dieting in the United States, 38 percent -- about 28 million -- are men, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a market research company. It estimates that the diet industry will be $58.7 billion this year. And NutriSystem has hired its first male spokesman, the former quarterback Dan Marino, and has started advertising in Sports Illustrated, Men's Health and ESPN magazine. [C3.] MAINSTREAM PROMOTION Mel Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' demonstrated to Hollywood just how many evangelical moviegoers there are and how much money can be made from them. Mindful of that market, Universal Pictures has teamed up with Grace Hill Media, a public relations firm that reaches out to religious groups, to publicize the mainstream film ''Evan Almighty.'' Scheduled for wide release on June 22, it stars Steve Carell as a politician who abandons Congress in order to build an ark, taking off on the story of Noah. [C3.] TALLYING GLIMPSES When the sleek yacht of the Luna Rossa team sailed away with a victory in the America's Cup semifinals, there were two vital results. The Italian crew eliminated the American team of BMW Oracle Racing with a 33-second lead. And fleeting glimpses of the flapping mainsails -- branded with logos of Telecom Italia Mobile and the broadband service Alice -- reached millions of television viewers. Those glimpses are now being counted down to the second, categorized by clear and partial visibility, tallied by major countries and then compared with the cost of traditional spot advertisements. [C2.] WEB PROPERTY DEVELOPER NameMedia, a privately held owner and developer of Web sites based in Waltham, Mass., is best seen as an online property developer, its chief executive, Kelly P. Conlin, said. Analysts suggest that NameMedia and its competitors could represent the next wave of Internet initial public offerings, while also providing a peek at a significant change in what people see when they stumble onto obscure Web properties. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. [C5.] THE TOUCH-UP In a situation not as emotionally charged as when Time magazine darkened O.J. Simpson's mug shot on its cover a decade ago, no fewer than three magazines were reacting to claims last week that they had doctored their covers -- and one retouched celebrity even cried foul. [C4.] A PULITZER AWARD Often the writing and photography that win Pulitzer Prizes require heroic efforts. For one recipient, Jahangir Razmi , the process of receiving the award also took 27 years. In 1979, Mr. Razmi stood near executioners as they shot Kurdish prisoners in Sanandaj, Iran. One picture was picked up by the wire service United Press International. To protect Mr. Razmi, his name was never printed. But after decades of keeping silent, Mr. Razmi allowed his name to appear in a December 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, which prompted the Pulitzer Prize Board to seek out Mr. Razmi to award him the prize in person. [C4.] VIEWER REVOLT The cancellation of the CBS series ''Jericho'' has led to a viewer revolt that has included not only the usual petition drives, but also the delivery of tons of nuts (mostly walnuts, but also peanuts and pecans) to the two responsible CBS executives. [C4.] THE PRETEEN MARKET With a faithful audience in the millions, magazines for the early teenage years are in overdrive, bolstered by last year's enthusiasm for new stars from the Disney Channel's hit ''High School Musical,'' which made household names not only of Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu, but also of Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne Hudgens.

Yet as the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Andrew Keen points out in his provocative new book, ''The Cult of the Amateur,'' Web 2.0 has a dark side as well. Mr. Keen argues that ''what the Web 2.0 revolution is really delivering is superficial observations of the world around us rather than deep analysis, shrill opinion rather than considered judgment.''

The first one to the punch was a longtime Wikipedia contributor known as CltFn, who at about 7 that morning created what's called a stub -- little more than a placeholder, often just one sentence in length, which other contributors may then build upon -- under the heading ''Fort Dix Terror Plot.'' A while later, another Wikipedia user named Gracenotes took an interest as well. Over the next several hours, in constant cyberconversation with an ever-growing pack of other self-appointed editors, Gracenotes -- whose real name is Matthew Gruen -- expanded and corrected this stub 59 times, ultimately shaping it into a respectable, balanced and even footnoted 50-line account of that day's major development in the war on terror.

The judge, Cesare Tacconi, indicted the bank and scheduled the trial to start Jan. 23. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., said the charges were not criminal but ''purely administrative in nature'' and ''completely unfounded.'' In June, four other banks -- Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley -- were ordered to face trial in Milan on charges that they failed to take steps that might have prevented Parmalat's failure.

A secret code opens a gate, and then another set of numbers gets you into the building. Walking down a dim hallway and up the stairs, you hear the crisp, increasingly loud tick of ball against paddle -- a metronome run amok. Inside the club, a royal blue room punctuated by grass green and blue tables, guys in baggy shorts, headbands and sweat-soaked T-shirts are running in place, gluing sheets of rubber to paddles and whacking balls at one another. ''With golf,'' said Rick Mueller, a 39-year-old dentist, ''you only get to hit the ball once in a while. Here you hit balls constantly, all night.'' Stick around the club long enough, and you'll learn about more than smashing serves. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of competitive Ping-Pong -- and the more than 240 table-tennis clubs cloistered in warehouses, senior centers, bingo parlors and gymnasiums across the country -- might be that it can lead a curious eater to his next favorite meal. So I discovered from Lindsey Simon, a techie friend and avid Ping-Pong player who recently moved to San Francisco to work for Google. ''Many of the guys I play with don't necessarily have a shared childhood,'' Simon explained, ''so after Ping-Pong, food is the most common language.''", "headline": {"main": "The Hot Table", "kicker": "FOOD: THE WAY WE EAT"}, "abstract": "Paula Disbrowe article on exploration of new cuisines by members of table-tennis clubs across US, which draw players from parts of world where sport is taken very seriously; recipe for eggplant with garlic sauce; photos (M)", "print_page": "47", "word_count": 1465, "_id": "4fd27f038eb7c8105d848c04", "snippet": "Ping-Pong and pork buns make a smashing combination.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02food-t.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food75.1.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food75.1.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food600.1.jpg", "height": 300, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food600.1.jpg", "xlargeheight": 300}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "AUSTIN (TEX)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TENNIS, TABLE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Paula", "lastname": "DISBROWE"}], "original": "By PAULA DISBROWE"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-09-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine", "lead_paragraph": "Ping-Pong and pork buns make a smashing combination.", "headline": {"seo": "Food - Recipes - Cookbooks - Dining - Restaurants", "main": "The Hot Table", "kicker": "Food: The Way We Eat", "print_headline": "The Hot Table", "content_kicker": "Food: The Way We Eat"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "47", "word_count": "1454", "_id": "5484a52c38f0d84e18ddf0b6", "snippet": "Ping-Pong and pork buns make a smashing combination.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02food-t.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food600.1.jpg", "height": 300, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food600.1.jpg", "xlargeheight": "300"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food75.1.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2007/08/31/magazine/02food75.1.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Tennis, Table", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Food", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Austin (Tex)", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "Recipes", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Cooking and Cookbooks", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Paula", "lastname": "DISBROWE"}], "original": "By PAULA DISBROWE"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-09-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 24, "offset": 20, "time": 36}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

And they were well aware of it.

In The Times?\" (Dec. 16): While I can appreciate the fact that T magazine might not have been the most appropriate venue for this photo editorial, it is interesting to see how it has been perceived by so many people.It is also fascinating that people think that they have the right to judge so severely and with such vengeance.Perhaps these are the same people who would not enter an art museum unless the statues were covered in drapes. In Europe, the pictures in question would never elicit the least bit of controversy.There is nothing \"minor\" about Ali. She is an old soul who is an extremely intelligent, focused, disciplined, responsible young lady. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. While she is a few months shy of her 18th birthday, she is more mature than most adults twice her age.She has had the good fortune to work with some of the world's best-known photographers over the past two years, including Paolo Roversi. He is an icon in the fashion industry. While I am with Ali every step of the way, it is not up to me to choose which photographs are to be published. I do not have control over that decision-making process. That said, there is nothing remotely sexual or pornographic about the pictures in the T. In my eyes, they portray a sense of innocence and beauty.To those who have responded to your column by criticizing my daughter and me so vehemently: Please understand that I have my viewpoint, and you have yours. It is unacceptable for you to demand that we think exactly alike, and it is unconscionable that you feel the need to judge or attack while expressing your views. After all, we come from totally different backgrounds and perspectives and are each entitled to our opinions.Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. If you don't like what you see, keep in mind that no one is forcing you to look. MaryAnn MichaelColleyville, Tex., Dec. 19, 2007 \u25cf On the one hand, you're right. I don't read T. On the other hand, now that you bring it up, those photos of that 17-year-old model are not fit for a newspaper with general circulation.Exposing as much as possible of a minor's body for commercial gain (but without getting arrested) is immoral, no matter how artful the photography.The Times can find some other way to sell its paper than exploiting even a willing minor whose parents care more about her career than about the character of our culture.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 \" \u25cf Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine, justifies his decision to expose a youngster's breast in a fashion spread by blurring the line separating commercial images from \"art.\"He acknowledges that \"sexually charged\" images sell products, so does he really suffer under the same illusion as the mother of the 17-year-old model, who found the layout to be \"very artistic in nature\"? Have we become so cynical that the currency of a young body can be peddled as \"art\" even in the most commercial of contexts?Rebecca ReichmannRancho Santa Fe, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 \u25cf I guess I am glad I never buy the Sunday Times. It's not so much that I disapprove of the T magazine section (I've never seen it, I think), but that I would resent paying for it and disposing of it greenly.I do buy and read the daily Times every day, and subscribe to the Book Review. Much of the reason I don't buy the Sunday Times is that there is so much in it I really have no interest in.Emily Ann SchmalzerBrentwood, N.H., Dec. 17, 2007 \u25cf Ordinarily I automatically dump T in the T-rash without even opening it, along with other glossy ads for things I'll never need or want. But your column prodded me to have a look online at the 17-year-old model posing semi-nude.What a disappointment! She's no Lolita, just an underweight kid posing in a grown-up's overpriced duds. And that barely perceptible bare breast was so badly out of focus that it registered zero on both the photographic and sexuality meters.The only astonishing thing about the photos was the revelation that a $3,890 Galliano taffeta coat could be worn, as the caption states, as a skirt.No, these photos didn't register as pornographic nor tawdry - nor even edgy. Aaron EpsteinWashington, Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf Can fashion photographs be \"art\"? The word was used by many cited in your column.I have just viewed the photos of Ali Michael. I find an unmistakable reference to Degas' sculpture of the 14-year-old dancer in the focused photo with a taffeta coat: the tied hair, the arms straight behind the back, the use of material in an original way, not to mention the insecurity of youth bravely confronting the hostilities of the world, including that of sexual exploitation.The great difference for these two models is, of course, exposure. Degas' model posed in private; the resulting sculpture became the vehicle of expression.Ms. Michael is viewed by millions and is herself, to a far greater extent, the vehicle of expression. Her body has, in a sense, been designed to meet certain criteria of the modeling circuit, achieving that white, emaciated, vulnerable look.My concern for Ms. Michael is that the look of breakable china may go deeper than art or artifice.John DannAmherst, Mass., Dec. 17, 2007The writer is a painter and sculptor. \u25cf Gee whiz, the Gray Lady is getting frisky. The soul-searching regarding this issue stands in stark (sorry) contrast to the Mapplethorpe uproar several years ago.At that time, Cincinnati decided that his work would shock and offend the good citizens of Cincinnati. The Times scolded the Queen City for its provincial prudery, in articles and editorials. It's art, not porn, it proclaimed.Maybe yes, maybe no - either way, has The Times yet published even one of the \"offending\" photos? I haven't seen one.Yes, of course, there are certain standards and unwritten laws (mostly involving advertising revenue) that must be considered - or are there?Give us a break. The Times is way ahead of the field in bowdlerizing words and images, while preaching open-mindedness to the benighted citizenry. Lionel LibsonCamden, Me., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf The bright line T magazine needs to find is not is not one that \"separates sexually charged images of men and women just short of 18 from art,\" as Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of the Magazine says, it is the bright line that separates pornography from child pornography. If the model is, or looks, under-age, The Times should do itself and the world a favor. Hire a grown-up. Then readers can decide for themselves whether it is too nasty to have in the house, and editors can decide whether it is too nasty to have in The New York Times.Kathleen A. PoolPortland, Ore., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf The photographs are neither sexy nor tawdry. The model is indeed showing a lot of skin, but she is much too skinny.Yale RichmondWashington, Dec. 17, 2007 \u25cf You are a brave man. In today's culture, you could be accused of censorship, prudery, proselytizing ... a whole host of rocks could be thrown your way. And probably will be. I hope you can duck.The quest for material gain should never intrude on values. Keep explaining this to Jim Schachter, Bill Keller and all those at The Times who don't seem to understand this.Bill FabrizioEast Atlantic Beach, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2007 \u25cf Your column was much ado about nothing. After refreshing my memory with the pictures, I found the offending photo to be so indistinct as to be inoffensive and meaningless.The real issue was the exploitation of a minor in a semi-nude picture. This is the issue that you should have focused upon, not the poor-quality picture.Michael HermanNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf The Times risks losing its reputation by daring to see how far it can go in prurient appeal. If T magazine leads the way, can we expect its standards will show up in news sections? (News could serve up photos of the yearly naked run of students at Tufts, pictures of a bare breast at the Super Bowl halftime show.)If there are going to be double standards for sections of the paper, perhaps subscribers should be allowed to opt out of receiving T.S. E. SoderlindShort Hills, N.J., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf I fear your column only stokes the fires of censorship by suggesting that art photography in The Times should be held to a different standard for good taste than that appearing in a specialist publication like V simply because The Times is sold to those who don't seek or expect to find such images in their daily newspaper.This notion perpetuates America's puritanical neurosis about the portrayal of the human form in any medium.While I found T's photos (and most fashion or lifestyle photography today) to be silly, incomprehensible and pointless, I have no objection to it being offered up to those readers and advertisers willing to pay the big bucks to keep The Times and the industry for luxury products afloat.It would be far more objectionable for The Times to censor creative people who are exploring the edge of good taste to avoid offending a moralistic minority. Those people have nothing better to do than tell everyone else how to live their lives, and they won't be satisfied no matter what you do.Whether the subject is fashion photography or news reportage, most thinking people can decide for themselves what content they want to see in their daily reading. P. Douglas FolkPhoenix, Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf The Holiday 2007 T magazine was very disturbing to me. After glancing through it and seeing the article with the young teenager, I was disconcerted by what I considered a step beyond art, pushing the images to a questionable level of good taste.Frankly, the entire issue left a stressed-out, overly commercial, lacking-in-substance impression. If I wished to read this type of magazine, I would buy it. Unfortunately, the past and present issue of T land in my waste basket often with but a glance.It is very revealing when the top editors have become inured to what that \"edge\" means to those of us who are not Seventh Avenue-hardened. The cult of the skinny anorexic models has gone too far. If you've ever known a young person who suffers this life-threatening state, it is neither attractive nor appealing.Ruth Mary PollackGuilford, Conn., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf While neither tawdry or pornographic, as you say, the pictures you refer to probably startled quite a few readers, coming as they did in their Sunday morning paper.I do question the contention that content in T pushes limits that the regular paper does not. I recall seeing a photograph accompanying a review of the play \"Lulu\" in the Nov. 29 Arts pages. The picture was a highly sexualized young lady (probably not a teen, though, and I recognize that this likely changes the conversation), sitting with her legs spread around a seated man whose pants are around his ankles.I don't point this out to criticize any of the pictures I've seen in The Times. I am far more inclined to take umbrage at a smug-looking Dick Cheney on Page 1 than any mildly erotic image within separate sections of the paper. I only wish to demonstrate that this sort of eroticism may be more prevalent in your paper than you might think. Ralph W. SiddallDes Moines, Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf My children are children no longer. I am more liberal than most, with a particularly strong perspective on censorship, but it is neither the parent nor the political animal in me that is concerned to see these pictures in a Times publication.No matter how seriously editors make decisions when skating the edge of child pornography, they are already over the edge in my book.The Times's willingness to exploit this edge pushes me toward The Wall Street Journal. It's easier to sort out that publication's bias than to trust a company that would skim this edge. By sexualizing childhood for the sake of sales, The Times positions itself among a new batch of competitors.Longtime readers want The Times to move with the times, but this move reads as a sign that the Times may be morphing into something unrecognizable to this reader.Pamela MilesNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf I looked at the pictures on the Web site. Although, as Ali Michael's mother said, she may be \"very modest,\" her garb and poses cross my line of what we used to call decency.My mother always demanded of me and my siblings that we do nothing in public that we would not do at home. That's my line, and in my opinion, Ms. Michael crossed it.The Times should not have printed the pictures, regardless of the age of the model.Bill AbbottSaratoga, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 \u25cf That glossy magazine The Times throws at us 15 times a year is not part of the \"culture.\" That's just an excuse to make more money for The Times.What happened to the wonderful magazine The Times used to give us at holiday time, showing New Yorkers and visitors the maps of the city and where each great holiday happening would be?Get back to basics and stop the stupid designer nonsense I throw in the garbage. And no more of these \"culture\" excuses.Estelle BrunoWest Sayville, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf Had I been a responsible editor asked to decide on those photographs, I would have nixed them. But not so much for the sexual suggestiveness as to avoid rewarding the physical child abuse of which they appear to be incontrovertible proof.As my wife instantly observed when I sought her opinion, that poor girl looks starved. The only visible curve on her is the profile of her breast. If she's not anorexic or bulemic, then she is suffering from something else that also needs urgent medical attention.Isn't the \"fashion\" industry belatedly recognizing this problem? Should The Times, or any newspaper, be part of the solution instead of the problem?Martin A. DyckmanWaynesville, N.C., Dec. 16, 2007 \u25cf Those critics have too much time and too little do. Pornography is in the mind of the beholder. They must have filthy minds.Peter J. PeiranoRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 17, 2007\u25cf\u25cfRe \"If It's Fit to Blog, Is It Fit to Print?\" (Dec. 9):It may have been the correct decision to keep from the printed version of The Times the quote from the book by Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, that suggested President Bush had lied to him since Mr. McClellan had already said to Larry King on CNN that he didn't think Mr. Bush had knowingly pressed him to divulge false information.All the fuss over Mr. Bush seems to have eclipsed the fact that Mr. McClellan's statement also included Vice President Dick Cheney, Andrew Card, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.They were not similarly excused by Mr. McClellan on \"Larry King Live.\" How about mentioning that in the printed version of The New York Times? And how about a follow-up investigation of the fabulating four by Times reporters?James D. PoissonWakefield, R.I., Dec. 9, 2007 \u25cf Your analysis of the excerpt from Scott McClellan's not-yet-released book about the leak that led to Scooter Libby's conviction raised compelling journalistic issues. But it glossed right over the substantive issue, arguing that the president may not have been one of the five who knew that Mr. McClellan was being asked to lie to the public and that therefore the leak story didn't go to print.Wouldn't the story of the president and his press secretary being lied to by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney and the president's own chief of staff be front-page news?Mary E. FellowsPortland, Ore., Dec. 10, 2007\u25cfI have written in before to complain about The Times Magazine's use of veryyoung-looking models. This may be the first actual breast, but spreadsfeaturing heavily made-up girls who look 12 or 14, sprawled in provocative,slutty poses are a standard feature of T \u00ad thumb through some back issues.I'm a Times subscriber in Tucson, and from here, obviously, the standardsof the New York fashion world (not to say the fashions themselves) arefairly incomprehensible. I take The Times to feel as if I know what'sreally going on, and despite some disappointments in the tone andindependence of the coverage, I love the paper and depend upon it. But thisold-hippie, staunchly anticensorship liberal is honestly shocked by theeditors' lack of attention to the demi-child-porn in some of your fashionlayouts.If the Times lets fashion photographers, under-age models and their stagemothers decide what's within the bounds of good taste, readers willcontinue to complain and editors will continue to have to explain howimages to delight pedophiles got into their newspaper.Renee DowningTucson, Dec. 16, 2007", "headline": {"main": "Letters: The Readers Speak", "kicker": "The Public Editor's Journal"}, "abstract": "Re \"A Semi-Nude Minor?
