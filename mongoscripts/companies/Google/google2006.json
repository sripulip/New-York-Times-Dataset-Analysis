He is co-author, with Chris Trimble, of ''10 Rules for Strategic Innovators: From Idea to Execution,'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2005, $29.95). Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Why is the subject of innovation so hot these days? A. In the 1990's, people were just rolling the dice and spending billions of dollars. It was reckless innovation. Post-9/11 and the dot-com bursting, people went back to cost-cutting. But now they also said, ''After Act I is over, we must create growth and innovation.'' This time, they're saying, ''We want to grow, but minimize risks and grow profitably.'' Innovation has come back with a different twist. It's very much on the agenda of chief executive officers. Without growth and innovation, organizations die. Q. Is this fascination with innovation being driven by the emergence of new competitors from China and India? A. The emergence of India and China has made innovation extremely critical. Together they are about $2 trillion in gross domestic product. That's only 5 percent of the world's G.D.P. But if these two economies grow at the rate at which the World Bank and Goldman Sachs predict, then tens of trillions of dollars worth of economic activity will be created in the next 25 years. Q. Are larger companies a more important source of American innovation than smaller ones? A. I would not say it is ''either'' or ''or.'' We need small start-ups to continue the innovation stream. But I believe that only large companies like General Electric can solve big, complex problems, which can make a huge difference to humanity. Q. Which are the most innovative large companies today? A. There is no perfect example. G.E., eBay, Johnson & Johnson and 3M come to mind. This is a topic that almost every company is concerned about. When you are a large, established, tradition-bound company, to fundamentally innovate, it's not in your genes. Fundamental innovation implies that you have to selectively forget some of the things you're doing well today. That's not so easy. Q. You say that Apple is among the best innovators in the technology world. Which other companies belong on that list? A. Motorola. They stumbled in the 90's and missed the boat on several things. But in the past three or four years, it has regained its dominant position. A third company is Google. Some people said it was just a fad and would disappear. But they have created a whole new space and continue to change the rules of the game. Q. The largest 500 companies in the country have been net shedders of jobs. Shouldn't they be considered consolidators, not innovators? A. Yes and no. It is true that if you look at Fortune 500 companies, many of them have focused on cost-cutting, re-engineering and restructuring, all of which means shedding jobs. It will be a real shame if companies go bankrupt because they just simply shed jobs. The question is, how do we stop it? They have a lot of capabilities. We as a country must help these companies to maintain an innovative spirit. Q. Say I'm the chief executive of a major company. Is there a secret to achieving innovation in my company? A. First, strategic innovation is critical for you. Don't ignore it. In addition to continuous process improvement, focus on strategic innovation. Secondly, coming up with a new idea is only the starting point. You need to pay attention to execution of the idea. Q. What else do I need to do? A. You must be able to forget some of the success formula by which you are succeeding today. By definition, that's irrelevant. Secondly, you must be able to borrow one or two of the core assets of your company and lend them to the new idea. Q. What's the final part of the challenge? A. The new venture must learn to resolve uncertainties. There are always questions about the size of the market, what the customer needs, what the technology solutions are -- these are always unknown. It's the person who resolves the uncertainties and learns the fastest who will win. Q. Exactly who should manage the hot new idea? A. You must hire an outsider to run the breakthrough idea because insiders are always wedded to orthodoxy and the inside success formula. You must also hire liberally from outside. Hiring from within kills breakthrough innovation. And the business should report to the C.E.O. even if it is very small. It must get the same organizational status as other business units or it is going to be suffocated. Q. So would you say the chief executive has an important role in making breakthrough innovation possible? A. A tremendously important role. I consider the C.E.O.'s role in the modern corporation to be building the capacity to continuously innovate in a breakthrough way. The C.E.O. doesn't create the strategy, but should be listening to the voices of people who are able to see the future. It is the role of the C.E.O. to spot and encourage them. Then, once an idea has promise, you must help build a separate organization around that person.", "headline": {"main": "Novel Thinking As a Survival Tactic", "kicker": "OFFICE SPACE: ARMCHAIR M.B.A."}, "abstract": "Excerpts from conversation with Vijay Govindarajan, professor of international business at Dartmouth, on importance of break-through innovations to US economy and role of chief executive officers in building capacity to innovate; drawing (M)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 890, "_id": "4fd269328eb7c8105d81f963", "snippet": "Success in the future may mean forgetting the strategies of today.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/business/yourmoney/01advi.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/12/31/business/01advi.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/12/31/business/01advi.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GOVINDARAJAN, VIJAY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INCORPORATED"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DARTMOUTH COLLEGE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORLD BANK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIRING AND PROMOTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "HOLSTEIN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By WILLIAM J.

Working for Google as a Sideline Feeling depressed because you missed out on Google's stock bonanza? Not to worry. Just get on the company's shadow payroll. Hundreds of thousands of people have essentially done just that by starting blogs, forums or other informational sites and getting paid for posting ads on Google's behalf. The trickle-down effect from Google does not stop at fledgling entrepreneurs. A growing number of rank-and-file contributors to Web sites, including Shawn Hogan, above, of Digital Point Solutions are also profiting. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. C7. A Media Company in Shanghai Looks to the West It is more than 7,000 miles from New York to Shanghai, but the workings of media companies like Time Warner and NBC Universal loom large in the mind of Li Ruigang, who runs the Shanghai Media Group, a budding conglomerate with a striking number of tentacles in media and entertainment and a considerable thirst for partnerships with foreign media companies. The wide scope of its activities and the pace with which Mr. Li has sought out Western partners in less than four years have established him as a favored ally for companies trying to crack China's vast market. C1. Television Ads Find a Place in Cellphones Television-style advertising is coming to the mobile phone, part of a broader push by marketers to create a new generation of ''up close and personal'' ads by delivering video, audio, banner displays and text clips over a device carried by most American adults. Marketers said they were particularly excited about the prospect of eventually using cellphones, many of which have global positioning systems, to send ads to consumers based on their locations. C1. Icahn Struggles to Find a Board for Time Warner As a dissident shareholder, Carl C. Icahn has criticized the management and board of Time Warner and has vowed to start a proxy fight to replace the board. But Mr. Icahn reportedly is having trouble finding media executives to join the board, a claim that he disputes. C1. Over the years, Carl C. Icahn has made a fortune as a corporate raider who is perhaps best known for his battle to get RJR Nabisco to split itself into two. But Mr. Icahn's magic touch seems to have eluded him with Blockbuster, a company in which he and his fund have accumulated 17 million shares at an average price of about $8. On Friday, Blockbuster closed at $3.83. C3.

C4. Agreement Keeps Canadian Debate Off Comedy Networks Some Americans are still taken by the novelty of fake-news broadcasts like ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.'' In Canada, news parodies sometimes draw larger audiences than the real thing. But during the current Canadian federal election campaign, Canada's TV satirists have faced an issue that has never troubled ''The Daily Show.'' An agreement between Canada's main TV networks and its largest political parties bans the shows from using film from televised debates (although the clips are available to conventional news and current affairs shows). C4. Because of the spread of digital video recorders, the people who measure television audiences have had to expand the definition of ''live'' to mean ''anytime this week.'' Nielsen Media Research changed its ratings system to include data from digital video recorders. But the new system may pose a problem for Nielsen's clients. C4 Uncommon Promotions for Unusual Films The marketing of movies is about finding an audience. But what if an audience does not want to be found? This was the problem facing Sony Pictures Classics, which is distributing ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.'' Not surprisingly, one of this film's target audiences is Mexican immigrants -- both legal and illegal. Like many makers and distributors of independent films, Sony Classics had to do more than spend money to promote the film. It had to tap its ingenuity. Advertising. C5. A Wireless System That Believes in Sharing Two West Coast start-ups -- Mushroom Networks and WiBoost Inc. -- have built prototypes of simple wireless systems that make it possible for groups of neighbors to share their D.S.L. or cable Internet connections.

The department sued Google this week, seeking one week's worth of Web searches and a million addresses in the company's database. ''We are trying to gather up information in order to help the enforcement of a federal law to ensure the protection, quite frankly, of our nation's children against pornography,'' Mr. Gonzales said.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS) Supervalu Group Bidding Again for Albertson's Albertson's Inc., the grocery chain, and Supervalu Inc. have resumed talks on a merger deal in which Albertson's would be acquired by a group led by Supervalu and the CVS Corporation, the companies said yesterday. The group also includes Cerberus Capital Management and the Kimco Realty Corporation. A price was not disclosed but Albertson's has a market value of $8.93 billion and about $5.63 billion in debt. A transaction would give Supervalu, a discount grocer, more than 1,100 new stores in urban markets, including Chicago, and allow CVS, the drugstore chain, to add 700 stores, mostly in the West. Supervalu, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., currently operates more than 1,500 stores in 40 states. Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, put itself up for sale in September and nearly reached an agreement in December to be acquired for $9.6 billion by the same group, but those talks fell apart for reasons that were not disclosed. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Danaher to Acquire a British Sensor Maker The Danaher Corporation, a maker of electronic testing equipment, agreed yesterday to buy a sensor company, First Technology, for \u00a3251 million ($441 million), topping an offer from Honeywell International. Danaher will pay 330 pence a share for First Technology, which makes gas detection gear, auto controls and crash test dummies, the company said. The price is \u00a344 million more than Honeywell's bid last month. First Technology's board unanimously recommended Danaher's offer. Danaher, based in Washington, has completed at least 11 acquisitions in the last two years, with a total value of more than $1.49 billion. Shares of First Technology, based in Egham, near London, surged 27 percent, to 351 pence, 21 pence more than Danaher's bid, suggesting investors think a higher bid might be forthcoming. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Nuclear Plant Owner Fined for Hiding Damage The owner of an Ohio nuclear plant agreed to pay $28 million in fines, restitution and community service yesterday over the cover-up of an acid leak that nearly ate through the reactor vessel's 6-inch-thick steel cap. The owner, the FirstEnergy Corporation, acknowledged that workers at its Davis-Besse plant, on Lake Erie about 30 miles east of Toledo, had concealed the damage. A federal grand jury indicted two former Davis-Besse employees and a contractor on Thursday on charges of hiding the damage from regulators. FirstEnergy also agreed to adopt certain safety standards at the plant and was prohibited from passing the fine along to its customers. (AP) Siemens Subsidiary Charged With Fraud in Chicago A subsidiary of Siemens and two of its executives have been indicted on charges of forming a sham partnership with a minority-owned company to land a $49 million county contract, federal prosecutors in Chicago said yesterday. The minority-owned company and its owner were also charged. Both were previously indicted on other charges. Siemens Medical Solutions USA was charged with fraudulently telling officials it was joining with minority-owned Faustech Industries in the bid to provide radiology equipment for a new hospital in Cook County. Prosecutors said Siemens had claimed the partnership with Faustech because county officials required bidders to have 30 percent minority ownership. According to the indictment, Siemens paid Faustech's owner, Faust Villazan, $500,000 to pose as a partner. A spokesman for Siemens said the company had broken no laws and would fight the charges. Mr. Villazan and Faustech have denied the charges. (AP) Fourth-Quarter Profit Declined at Johnson Controls Johnson Controls said yesterday that its earnings fell for the first time in almost five years in the fourth quarter, pulled down by expenses from its purchase of the York International Corporation and higher raw materials prices. Its forecast for second-quarter profit was lower than analysts' estimates, setting off an 8 percent decline in its stock price. Johnson Controls, which is the largest automotive seat maker, bought York's heating and air conditioning business to reduce its dependence on supplying auto companies. It expects sales from the climate control division to almost double in 2006. Johnson Controls, which is based in Milwaukee, said net income fell 1.8 percent, to $165.4 million, or 85 cents a share, and sales rose 14 percent, to $7.53 billion. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Pension Fund Opposes Bank's Proposed Stake Sale The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to block a transaction between Sovereign Bancorp and Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain because shareholders were not allowed to vote on it. The pension fund backed the efforts of Sovereign's largest shareholder, Relational Investors, to stop the bank from selling a 19.8 percent stake to Santander for $2.4 billion. Sovereign, which is based in Philadelphia, plans to use proceeds from the Santander transaction to help buy the Independence Community Bank Corporation of Brooklyn for $3.6 billion.

Jobs of Apple a seat on Disney's board. Whatever the board decides, the aggressive pursuit of a deal by Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, speaks volumes about his own ambitions and how he perceives his company's future. [Page C1.] The calculus of Disney in seeking to acquire Pixar is simple: big media conglomerate plus vaunted computer animation studio plus closer ties with Steven P. Jobs, the maverick Pixar founder, equals potential powerhouse. But because Mr. Jobs's other job is chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, a deal also raises the possibility of a warmer relationship between Disney and Apple if Mr. Jobs plays an active role at the company.

David Carr. [C1.] New Health Site Aims to Challenge WebMD A new Web site owned by Healthline Networks acts as a medical search engine, finding articles on ailments and remedies from some 66,000 Web sites it has identified as providing medical content. In doing so, Healthline says it offers consumers a broader choice of information than WebMD, which is by far the most popular single medical resource online, and a more refined choice than general search engines like Google. Healthline's chairman and chief executive, West Shell III, above, said several factors argued in favor of the company's success this time around, after a similar venture was unsuccessful. Consumers remain deeply interested in online health information, he said, and pharmaceutical and other medical advertisers are starting to open their wallets more generously to the Web.

[C4.] The Risks and Rewards of Web Recommendations Web technology capable of compiling vast amounts of customer data makes it possible for online stores to recommend items tailored to a specific shopper's interests. Companies are finding that getting those personalized recommendations right -- or even close -- can mean significantly higher sales. But spewing out recommendations is not entirely without risk. [C1.] Films to Appear at Same Time in Theaters and on Cable Hollywood inched further toward making movies simultaneously available in theaters, on DVD and on television screens as IFC Entertainment unveiled a plan to release 24 films in theaters and on cable at the same time this year.

A houseman on the graveyard shift was not the most productive worker, and trying to reach him on his walkie-talkie was usually a lost cause. So when the employee could not be found one summer night, his bosses went to their new video surveillance system.

BATTLE OVER TIME WARNER -- The investment bank Lazard, which is advising the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn, above, in his effort to bring big changes to Time Warner, is expected to release a report tomorrow criticizing the company's performance and laying out a plan to break it up. Time Warner's management has paid little heed to Mr. Icahn's demands. EAT OUR VEGETABLES -- Reflecting concern among Europeans about the safety of genetically modified crops, the European Union has essentially barred their importation, prompting a complaint by the United States to the World Trade Organization. A preliminary decision on the complaint is expected to be issued tomorrow. NET POLITICS -- The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow about Internet neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers should treat all data moving through their pipes in the same way and not favor services in which they might have a financial interest, like movie downloads. Speakers are to include representatives from Google and Vonage. OIL'S EBB AND FLOW -- The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, is expected to be a prominent speaker at an energy conference organized by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, beginning tomorrow in Houston.

Behind the News -- The Democratic threat of a filibuster to block the nomination turned out to be largely empty. A small number of senators tried to stage a filibuster but lost a motion to close debate, 72 to 25. Many Democrats apparently took to heart Republican warnings that they would change the rules to bar filibusters against future judicial nominees if the effort against Judge Alito succeeded. QUICK PICKS The News -- The judge in the trial of two former Enron executives chose a jury in a single day. Behind the News -- Judge Simeon T. Lake III of Federal District Court in Houston followed through on his promise to act quickly, despite reservations voiced by lawyers for the defendants, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, who are accused of conspiring to defraud investors. Judge Lake winnowed 96 prospective jurors down to 38 and then gave both sides 40 minutes to eliminate others. The trial itself won't be so quick: it may last up to four months. QUICK DROP The News -- Google's stock price dropped more than 7 percent in a day when its fourth-quarter earnings failed to meet analysts' expectations. Behind the News -- The Web search company's fiscal results would make most chief executives crow with pride. But earnings of $372 million in the last quarter of 2005 -- an 82 percent increase from the same period a year before -- weren't enough for some investors, and per-share earnings were far below analysts' forecasts. The company had also weathered some rare bad publicity -- a new video download store was panned by some critics, and Google said it would enter the Chinese market with a version of its search engine that filters words and subjects deemed inappropriate by government censors. By the close of regular trading Wednesday, the stock was 15 percent lower than its high-water mark, reached only three weeks before. QUICK WINDFALL The News -- Wallace D. Malone Jr. received retirement benefits of $135 million when he stepped down as vice chairman of Wachovia. Behind the News -- Mr. Malone, 69, had only been on the job for 15 months. Before that he was chief executive of SouthTrust, which Wachovia bought in 2004. Most of the $135 million was awarded during Mr. Malone's time at SouthTrust.

A1 At least four Iraqis were killed in scattered violence across Iraq, as thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police officers began to move into place to protect Shiite pilgrims for a religious holiday this week. A12 The American military has begun leaving the duty of policing the Iraqi heartland to Iraqi soldiers and special forces. The overwhelmingly Shiite forces are using tough tactics and restoring some order, but are also provoking enduring bitterness among the country's Sunnis, which risks fueling the insurgency.

A8 Protest Against Thai Leader Opponents of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand organized a huge demonstration in Bangkok, and a second cabinet minister resigned as criticism mounted over Mr. Thaksin's recent business deals.

A16 Regulation of Road Memorials Roadside memorials have become so numerous, and so distracting and dangerous, highway officials say, that more and more states are trying to regulate them. Now, in a move that is being watched by other states, Delaware is taking a different approach, establishing a memorial park near a highway exit in hopes of discouraging the personal shrines.

A14 Lag in Bird Flu Plans The nation's 5,000 state and local health departments are rushing to make plans for an epidemic of avian flu, but they say they are hobbled by a lack of money and guidance from the federal government.

But in a business often associated with name-brand stars, diva-wrangling directors and picky playwrights, these are the people who help bring those characters' talents to a paying audience. They range from Tara Rubin, an unsuccessful actress turned very successful casting director (she has accounts with six musicals now running on Broadway) to Freddie Gershon, a smooth-talking show salesman whose work on the road keeps royalties rolling in for cash-poor creative types back in town. While much of the power on Broadway remains in the hands of the producers, the theater owners and the critics -- and much of the business's day-to-day is handled by camera-shy tribes of press agents and general managers -- many of this assembled cast are valuable specialists in an increasingly complex industry. Armed with talents like negotiation (see The Lawyers, The Labor Leaders), sales (The Licensers, The Group Seller), buzz (The Marketers) or taste (The Agents, The Casting Agents), each has a niche, if not a big name. Here is a selective look at some of the behind-the-scenes players on Broadway, what they do, and why. Even if you don't know their faces, the spring theater season would be hard to pull off without them. The Labor Leaders There are three men on Broadway with the power to shut it down, and one of them plays the viola. That's DAVID LENNON, 46, the wiry, thin-mustached president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, who closed Broadway for four days in 2003. The issue then was -- as it will be in March 2007 when the current contract expires -- the future of live music on Broadway, Mr. Lennon said. In particular, musicians are worried about ''virtual orchestras,'' advanced synthesizers that imitate the sound of actual musicians. ''I don't see technology as evil when it makes something better,'' said Mr. Lennon, who studied at Juilliard and has played on Broadway and with symphonic orchestras. ''But not when it destroys something.''", "headline": {"main": "Far From the Spotlight, the True Powers of Broadway", "kicker": "THEATER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 3242, "_id": "4fd267158eb7c8105d81c66f", "snippet": "Hoping to get a show in front of an audience on the Great White Way?

[Page A1.] RETREAT ON TAX PLAN -- Senate Republicans hurriedly abandoned a broad tax proposal opposed by the oil industry and business community, another sign of their struggle to come up with a legislative answer to high gasoline prices.

Behind the News -- Republicans held on to the seat, which was left vacant when Randy Cunningham resigned after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. But the thin victory margin of the winner, Brian P. Bilbray, was a sign that the party may be in for difficult times in more competitive districts. Campaigns were already in full swing in some of those districts, long before the traditional Labor Day start of the election season. CYBER-RIVALRY The News -- Google unveiled a new online spreadsheet program, the latest volley in its attacks against its rival Microsoft. Behind the News -- The free program, Google Spreadsheets, is designed to allow multiple users to work on a spreadsheet simultaneously. But more important, perhaps, is that it can read files created in Microsoft's popular program Excel. So it's another step in Google's efforts to make inroads on Microsoft's core business, desktop programs. Microsoft has countered in recent years by expanding its Web offerings. BOOMTOWN The News -- Construction contractors for the Freedom Tower announced they would begin work on the foundation by blasting away bedrock. Behind the News -- While the thought of more explosions at the World Trade Center site might be chilling to residents and workers in Lower Manhattan, those in charge of the project said that the detonations, to be carried out over two months, would hardly be noticeable. Blasting, they added, would produce far less dust and din than the constant pounding of an alternative method, hydraulic rams attached to backhoes. M-M-MEMORIES The News -- Barbra Streisand announced she would perform in 20 cities this fall, her first concert tour in a dozen years. Behind the News -- Since Ms. Streisand, 64, never really retired, it's not a comeback tour. A more accurate description might be ''marathon fund-raising event.'' The singer, who has long used her concerts to raise money for political causes, said she would donate proceeds this time to educational, environmental and women's health groups. PLAYTIME The News -- The 32-team World Cup soccer tournament got under way in Germany with the opening match in Munich. Behind the News -- Concerns about how the monthlong event might be affected by racist fans, bribable referees, an influx of prostitutes and even the shape of the ball dominated much of the discussion in the weeks leading up to it. Most of the worries melted away as play began, although German and English fans had to be separated by police officers in Frankfut.

The most direct method, of course, is to pay a dazzling salary, a common tactic at many of this country's elite law firms, which now pay first-year associates up to $145,000 a year (not including bonuses). Tech companies like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, woo engineers with visions of autonomy and stock options. Tighter financial constraints have prompted the social sector, on the other hand, to test different enticements. New York City recently introduced a program of housing subsidies -- up to $14,600 annually -- available to some teachers who might otherwise look for work elsewhere because of the area's stratospheric housing prices. And a few years ago, the National Institutes of Health began an ambitious experiment when it received Congressional authorization, and many millions of dollars, to create an educational loan-repayment program designed in large part to increase the ranks of this country's ''physician-scientists'' -- that is, M.D.'s who forgo private practice for a career that mixes patient care, typically at a university hospital, with research into diseases, diagnoses and treatments. In the entire United States, there are perhaps only 15,000 physician-scientists, down from more than 23,000 in the mid-1980's. For years, N.I.H. administrators have been watching this decline with concern, as medical-school graduates, carrying debt loads of $100,000 or more, increasingly choose private practices that are far more lucrative than scientific research posts.", "headline": {"main": "Forgive Us Our Student Debts", "kicker": "CHAPTER 3: THE STUDENT"}, "abstract": "Jon Gertner article on student loan debt and programs run by National Institutes of Health, graduate schools, state governments and other organizations to use loan forgiveness to encourage teachers, lawyers, social workers and health professionals to work in underserved geographic areas or among needy populations; drawings (L)", "print_page": "60", "word_count": 6160, "_id": "4fd287e18eb7c8105d85a0d3", "snippet": "Rising educational costs have created an opportunity to lure pharmacists to rural areas and teachers to cities \u0097 to do all sorts of engineering, in fact.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/magazine/11loans.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2006/06/07/magazine/11loans.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2006/06/07/magazine/11loans.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STUDENT LOANS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TUITION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jon", "lastname": "Gertner"}], "original": "By Jon Gertner"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-06-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Education; Health; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 8, "offset": 0, "time": 40}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

The team held an auction on eBay offering to write a play about the winning bidder and stage it at the Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. As it turned out, the auction was just the first of many wrinkles in the production, which opened this month and runs through July 1. The variables included eight writers working separately, an unknown subject, a cast of seven unpaid actors and a down-to-the wire schedule. While many Off Off Broadway troupes take less than two months from first rehearsal to opening night, as Youngblood did, most of them usually start with a script. Steven McElroy chronicled the life of ''The True Life Story of [Your Name Here].'' 46 DAYS TO GO Tom Ritchford, 43, a software engineer for Google, enters the auction, partly as a lark and partly as a way to tell the story of his parents, who both died of AIDS. He wins with a bid of $521, though he said he was willing to pay twice that. The show will now be known as ''The True Life Story of [Your Name Here]: Tom Ritchford.'' 38 DAYS TO GO The playwrights, led by R. J. Tolan and Graeme Gillis, the collective's artistic directors, wait in a Midtown bar to meet the auction winner. Their main concern is a boring subject. Mr. Ritchford bustles in late. He is energetic, nervous, speaks quickly with a British accent and flashes a big grin. Mr. Gillis turns to another writer: ''We're golden.'' Mr. Ritchford talks about himself for over an hour. He says little about his parents and much about his relationships with younger women. 37 DAYS TO GO The playwright Annie Baker and other writers have a problem. As she puts it in an e-mail message, ''I Did Not Love Tom Ritchford.'' While another playwright, Qui Nguyen, contemplates withdrawing, Ms. Baker incorporates her predicament into a scene and bases a character on herself. 27 DAYS TO GO In the midst of three weeks spent on the script Youngblood interviews Mr. Ritchford at his Brooklyn home. He describes the writers, with their many questions, as ''a collective girlfriend.'' Meanwhile Mr. Nguyen has returned to the project. 12 DAYS TO GO At a Williamsburg bar actors read a scene about Mr. Ritchford and his friend Pierre, who committed suicide years ago. Though the auction terms state that the winner has no control over the show, Mr. Ritchford tells an actor he's not playing Pierre right. Still, he is moved to tears: ''In the balance I was happy.'' 8 DAYS TO GO The cast is short one actor, the script consists of eight scenes that aren't finished, and the artistic directors are still struggling to link them. Rehearsals start anyway. 7 DAYS TO GO An actor who was to play Mr. Ritchford in several scenes leaves for paying work. Now the cast is down two actors, but Mr. Tolan is not upset: Youngblood knows others accustomed to its ''kamikaze timetable.'' 6 DAYS TO GO The final two actors are cast. 2 DAYS TO GO Mr. Ritchford shares the script with Talia Cohen, 19, whom he describes as ''a friend who in my wildest dreams I'd like to be my girlfriend.'' Although a scene sending up Mr. Ritchford and the women in his life calls a character based on Ms. Cohen ''a barely legal co-ed,'' she e-mails Mr. Ritchford: ''Tom it's amazing. Absolutely beautiful.'' THE DAY BEFORE The tech rehearsal is rough and lasts until midnight. Afterward, Mr. Gillis and Mr. Tolan (the director as well as the set, costume, sound and lighting designer) work three more hours, trimming the script and adjusting props and costumes. OPENING NIGHT Like the cast and crew, Mr. Ritchford is nervous, ''as if I were going on myself instead of just showing up.'' He sits in the front row and watches the finished product, which includes scenes from his childhood, his parents' deaths and his recent past. One aspect stands out for him, though, and at the end he stands up to announce to the audience, which includes friends and co-workers, ''There were no under-age girls.'' POSTMORTEM Mr. Tolan reports that Youngblood is interested in staging someone else's ''True Life Story.'' As for Mr. Ritchford, he signaled his approval on opening night by increasing his investment: he bought pitchers of beer for the Youngblood team.", "headline": {"main": "Countdown to a Play Written to Order", "kicker": "THEATER"}, "abstract": "Article describes how Youngblood, collective of playwrights under 30, held auction on eBay offering to write play about winning bidder and stage it at Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; chronology of process; photo (M)", "print_page": "10", "word_count": 739, "_id": "4fd254908eb7c8105d7fc4aa", "snippet": "Youngblood, a collective of playwrights under 30, recently held an auction offering to write a play about the winning bidder.

It is not. The question now is, Can it continue raising rates without choking off economic growth? Investors and others were wrestling with that question this week amid signs that prices are rising too fast even as economic growth appears to be slowing. 'UNWELCOME,' NOT UNEXPECTED -- Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent last month, and 0.3 percent after stripping out volatile food and energy costs. That pushed the annual rate to 2.4 percent this year. While economists had anticipated just that kind of increase, it still is in a range that the Federal Reserve chairman recently described as ''unwelcome.''

The summer travel season has started with airlines reporting record load factors, or the percentage of seats filled with paying customers. Here are the figures for June from the top six airlines: The load factor at United Airlines was 88.3 percent, the highest ever. The load factor at Delta Air Lines was 84.6 percent, largely driven by a 30.6 percent increase in international passengers over June 2005; on June 30, Delta's flights were 94.4 percent full -- the highest daily load factor ever, the airline said. The June load factor at US Airways was 84.3 percent, and at Northwest Airlines, it was 89.7 percent, also the highest ever. At Continental Airlines, the June figure was 84.8 percent. But at Southwest Airlines, by comparison, the load factor was a relatively roomy 73.8 percent. Meanwhile, flight delays are mounting. The 20 top domestic carriers achieved an overall on-time arrival rate of 78.3 percent in May, compared with 83.7 percent in May 2005, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Transportation Department. At the same time, airlines have fewer employees to handle increased business. In April, domestic airlines employed 4.8 percent fewer workers than in April 2005; that means April 2006 was the 16th consecutive month that the work force was lower than in the year-ago month, the bureau said. LESS ROOM, MORE MONEY AT THE INN -- Hotel rooms are going to be harder to find and they are going to cost more this summer than last, according to PKF Hospitality Research, which says domestic hotel occupancy rates are likely to average nearly 74.1 percent, the highest level since 1997. Room rates are forecast to be up 6 percent over last summer. And forget about just dropping in unexpectedly. ''It will be tough to find a hotel room during the summer of 2006 without booking in advance,'' said R. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research. TRANS-ATLANTIC BOOM -- With June load factors at 72 percent, the all-business-class carrier Eos Airlines said it was beginning a second daily flight in September from Kennedy International Airport to Stansted Airport in London. Eos, which began service last October, flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which typically hold 220 seats, configured with 48 premium lie-flat seats. Eos round-trip fares range from $2,950 for advance purchase to $6,500 walk-up (compared with more than $9,000 walk-up on major competitors). Reflecting the growing demand for New York-to-London service, British Airways said it was adding an eighth daily flight from Kennedy to Heathrow International Airport in December. British Air also has three daily flights serving Newark and Heathrow. BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE -- Many corporations are evidently returning to a policy that was sharply curtailed in the years after 9/11 -- allowing their traveling employees to tack a little time onto business trips for personal pleasure. According to the latest National Business Travel Monitor, 44 percent of business travelers now agree that they ''extend business trips for pleasure purposes'' whenever possible. That's up from 40 percent this time last year, according to YPB&R/Yankelovich, which publishes the monitor. NORTHWEST ELITE LANES -- Northwest has now joined several competitors and set aside special boarding lanes at departure gates for elite-status members of its WorldPerks frequent-flier program. The first-to-board lanes are also available to nonelite passengers with first class or World Business Class tickets, and to elite-status members of frequent flier programs of other airlines in the SkyTeam Alliance. COMPANION FLIERS -- Flying with a pet is, of course, infinitely more convenient on a private jet. Noting that many of its customers do take a pet along, NetJets, the leading fractional-share business jet company, has added a service giving domestic customers 24-hour telephone access for emergency or even general consultations with experts at the Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. NetJets said it flew nearly 10,000 pets on about 6,500 flights last year. Dogs and cats predominate, of course, but the pets have included a falcon, a wolf and a 250-pound kangaroo, said Maryann Aarseth, a NetJets spokeswoman. ONLINE HITS -- According to the online travel-data company Hitwise.com, these were the top 10 travel sites in May, ranked by the number of visits: MapQuest; Yahoo Maps; Expedia; Orbitz; Travelocity; Southwest Airlines; Cheap Tickets; Google Maps; Priceline; and Yahoo Travel. ET CETERA -- The most preferred hotel loyalty program in the world is Hilton HHonors, according to a survey of domestic and international travelers by Phoenix Marketing. But in the United States, Hilton HHonors shared the top-rated status with Marriott Rewards JetBlue just started more new routes: Burbank-Orlando, Fla.; Burbank-Las Vegas; and Boston-Buffalo, as well as routes from Pittsburgh to Kennedy International Airport and Pittsburgh to Boston. In September, JetBlue plans to start three new daily nonstops from Kennedy to Hobby Airport in Houston, with introductory one-way fares of $99.

Behind the News -- The plan will result in thousands of layoffs and a big drop in revenue for AOL, a division of Time Warner. But company executives say it's the only way to go: the continued focus on subscription services is detracting from efforts to compete with the free online services, they say. The hope is that the loss of revenue -- as much as $2 billion a year, some analysts say -- will ultimately be replaced by increased advertising income. THE TREATMENT The News -- The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve an AIDS treatment that consists of one pill a day. Behind the News -- For patients who remember having to take dozens of pills a day, the new pill -- a combination of three of the most widely used AIDS drugs made by two companies -- is a milestone. It should make it easier for people with AIDS to take their medicine and thus keep under control the virus that causes the disease. The treatment will still be expensive, about $1,200 a month, though the companies say they will make the pill available at reduced prices in developing nations. THE CONTRACT The News -- The Army plans to end a contract with Halliburton that has paid the company $15 billion since 2001. Behind the News -- The contract, for logistics work like building housing and delivering food and fuel, has been criticized by some politicians who say it has allowed Halliburton to charge high prices. Some critics also see it as an example of administration cronyism, since Halliburton used to be headed by Dick Cheney. The Army now plans to divide the work among as many as four companies, provided it can find them. There are few companies equipped to handle logistics work on this scale. THE CRIME The News -- Wal-Mart, which has vigorously prosecuted shoplifters, said it would give small-time thieves a break. Behind the News -- In internal documents, the company said it would let off first-time shoplifters with a warning if the value of the merchandise was less than $25. Wal-Mart said the policy change would allow it to concentrate on professional shoplifters and employee theft. The change may also be welcomed by police departments, many of which have grown tired of being summoned to the local Wal-Mart every time a shoplifter is caught, no matter how petty the theft. THE DIVA The News -- Deborah Voigt will return to the Royal Opera House in London after being dismissed two years ago because of her weight. Behind the News -- The Royal Opera decided in 2004 that Ms. Voigt was too heavy to perform her signature role, Ariadne in Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' given that the director had settled on a black evening dress as a costume. Since then, the soprano has had much publicized gastric-bypass surgery, and is 135 pounds lighter.

It is the 33rd product category Amazon has rolled out since it started expanding in the late 1990's, but for some it is the most puzzling, since it recalls some of the worst Internet business debacles on record.

Behind the News -- The loss was an embarrassment for Mr. Reed, the former leader of the state Republican Party, and an indication of the effect of lobbying scandals in Washington on voters. Mr. Reed had ties to Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist who pleaded guilty to fraud, bribery and other charges. Some Democrats were less than pleased with the primary outcome, taking the view that Mr. Reed's opponent, State Senator Casey Cagle, would be harder to defeat. CONNECTICUT The News -- A new poll showed that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut has lost ground in his re-election bid against a Democratic primary challenger. Behind the News -- Mr. Lieberman is struggling to save his political career. His standing among Democrats in the state has suffered, largely because of his support for the Iraq war. The latest poll, by Quinnipiac University, showed just how much the challenger, Ned Lamont, had benefited: he had 51 percent of the likely primary voters to 47 percent for Mr. Lieberman. Three months ago, Mr. Lamont, a cable TV executive, had 19 percent to Mr. Lieberman's 65 percent. SILICON VALLEY The News -- Yahoo reported weak ad revenue from its Internet search engine, sending the company's stock to a two-year low. Behind the News -- Yahoo runs the world's most popular Web site and it earns a lot of money from banners and other graphic advertisements. But it has fared poorly compared with the search-engine giant Google in producing revenue through so-called contextual ads -- text advertisements that are relevant to, and displayed with, a page of search results. Yahoo said that a software project meant to improve ad selection and increase revenue would be delayed by three months. CYBERSPACE The News -- The future of online gambling was clouded by the arrest in the United States of a top executive from a betting company in London. Behind the News -- The arrest of David Carruthers, above, of BetOnSports signals a new effort in the United States to curb online gambling, which generated $12 billion in profits last year. Federal officials have taken the position that they can prosecute operators of offshore sites because they do business with customers in the United States. And what a business they do: BetOnSports estimates that up to 80 percent of its wagers come from the United States. NEW YORK CITY The News -- New York City's tap water is getting increasingly muddier and may have to be filtered, at a cost of billions of dollars. Behind the News -- New York's water has long had a reputation as being better than bottled. But that reputation has been sullied in recent years, as clay and other particles washed into upstate reservoirs have made the water murkier. As a stopgap measure, the city has been using 16 tons of chemicals a day to purify the water so that it meets federal standards. But the Environmental Protection Agency says a full-scale filtration plant, which could cost about $8 billion, may be necessary.", "headline": {"main": "Setbacks | July 16-22", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 528, "_id": "4fd271ac8eb7c8105d82e052", "snippet": " GEORGIA    The News -- Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition, was easily defeated in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Georgia.

The Israeli prime minister spoke of a force consisting of European Union members with combat experience and the authority to take control of Lebanon's border and crossing points. A1 Israeli warplanes hit civilians escaping by vehicle from their villages in southern Lebanon at least six times in a series of fierce bombardments, witnesses and officials said. Lebanese Red Cross ambulance drivers complained about narrowly avoiding Israeli fire as they cleared out the wounded, and a Lebanese photographer was killed when an Israeli missile struck near her car. A1 Saudis Urge Cease-Fire A delegation from Saudi Arabia asked President Bush to push for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The foreign minister said he delivered a letter from the Saudi king, Abdullah, with suggestions for ending the violence. It met a cool reception from American Officials. A8 Syrian Calls U.S. Course Faulty The Bush administration's approach of indirectly pressuring Syria to drop support for Hezbollah is doomed to failure, said Bthaina Shaaban a top Syrian minister. Washington, she says, is ignoring reality if it thinks groups like Hezbollah and Hamas can be purged by allowing Israel to bomb at will. A9 Recruitment Troubles in Iraq Recruiting a new police force to battle the insurgents in Iraq has become a central element in the United States' plan to reduce American forces. American commanders face securing a modicum of cooperation from a wary population, and to contend with a campaign by insurgents to assassinate and intimidate the members of Iraq's fledgling security services. A10 Saddam Hussein was hospitalized after a hunger strike, and was being fed with a tube and given tests to ensure that he could continue to attend his trial, Iraqi and American officials said. Widespread sectarian violence returned after two days of relative calm, with at least 57 people killed in bombings in Baghdad and Kirkuk. A11 Artist Shadowed by Nazi Ties After years of obscurity, the first publicly financed exhibit since World War II of the work of Arno Breker, the German sculptor whose art so vividly expressed Nazi ideology that he became known as ''Hitler's favorite sculptor,'' is being mounted in Schwerin, Germany. The exhibit has ignited a debate in a region which has had a spurt of far-right and neo-Nazi political activity recently. A3 NATIONAL A12-15 U.S. to Limit Payments For Victims of Disaster The Department of Homeland Security, responding to months of criticism and ridicule, will sharply cut back on emergency cash assistance for victims of major disasters, and more carefully control access to free hotel rooms. Immediate emergency aid would not exceed $500 in cash instead of $2,000 per family under the new rules. A1 Bar Association Critical of Bush The American Bar Association said President Bush was flouting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law by claiming the power to disregard selected provisions of bills that he signed. In a comprehensive report, a bipartisan panel of the bar association said Mr. Bush had used such ''signing statements'' far more than his predecessor. A12 Sunday Services in Parks From Memorial Day to Labor Day, 42 state, national and private parks in Pennsylvania hold nondenominational Christian worship services. The chaplains come from local towns and faraway states, as do the worshipers, mostly Protestants. Last year, 18,000 people attended services in Pennsylvania parks. A13 Elderly Katrina Victims Struggle Thousands of elderly Hurricane Katrina evacuees still struggle to get by in cities hundreds of miles from their home in New Orleans. But more than most evacuees, it is the elderly who want most to return, say social service workers, and who have the hardest time doing so. A12 F.D.A. to Limit Industry Ties The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce an effort to write guidelines detailing the kind of industry ties that are permitted for those who serve on its powerful advisory boards. The agency hopes to appease critics who have complained that board members often have such deep financial ties to drug makers that their advice is tainted. A13 SCIENCE/HEALTH Stomach Surgery Called Risky Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said. A15 OBITUARIES B7 Thomas J. Manton A former congressman and New York City councilman who was chairman of the powerful Queens Democratic party for the past two decades, he was 73. B7 Walter Allner The Bauhaus-trained graphic designer and art director of Fortune magazine from 1962 to 1974 who introduced a European modernist typographic sensibility to American magazine design, he was 97. B7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Progress Made Restoring Electricity to Queens Consolidated Edison reported major progress in the week-old struggle to restore power to northwest Queens, but thousands faced a new work week without electricity and frustrations boiled over as some officials called for a declaration of emergency and the resignation of the utility's chief executive. A1 Last Fishing Shop Moves Capitol Fishing and Tackle, the last bait and tackle shop in Manhattan, is leaving the Chelsea Hotel, where it has resided for more than four decades. B1 Campaign Draws Big Names With their race quickly becoming a national symbol of rifts in the Democratic party, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and his challenger, Ned Lamont, are turning to national political stars to help bolster each of their campaigns, apparently hoping that the big names can help turn out votes in the coming primary for the Senate. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 Tiger Woods Wins British Open Tiger Woods shot five-under-par 67 at the 135th British Open to win the 11th professional major championship of his career. Mr. Woods's victory gave him back-to-back British Open titles, a feat last accomplished by Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale in 1983. Chris DiMarco shot 68 to finish second. D1 Landis Wins Tour de France Floyd Landis secured his first Tour de France victory, finishing the three-week, 2,267-mile race 57 seconds ahead of Oscar Pereiro of Spain. Mr. Landis kept the trophy in American hands after Lance Armstrong won it seven straight times before retiring. D1 ARTS E1-8 Bitter Breach for Pilobolus Pilobolus Dance Theater has become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the choreographer Alison Chase. Ms. Chase, who was one of the company's four artistic directors, broke away last fall after a bitter exchange of letters by lawyers. The dispute has split current and former trustees and company members. E1 BUSINESS DAY C1-8 Amvescap to Buy W.L. Ross Amvescap, a global investment company based in London, is acquiring W.L. Ross & Company, owned by the investor Wilbur Ross. Mr. Ross will remain with the company and manage Amvescap's private-equity business. C1 Macy's Reality TV Debut A new reality television series called ''Unwrapping Macy's,'' is the latest contribution to the emerging genre of corporate TV docudramas and appears to be the first reality show to revolve around an American retailer. C1 Internet Search Business The different approaches used by Google and Yahoo have defined a key front in the battle for online loyalty in the Internet search business. Yahoo tends to offer services that are consistent and predictable while Google has made a conscious choice to downplay copycat features, offering more innovative services. C1 Panasonic's New Plasma TV Panasonic said that it would begin selling a 103-inch flat-panel plasma television in the United States in time for the holiday season.

These are times, as you watch the young Swiss play, when the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you're O.K. The Moments are more intense if you've played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do. We've all got our examples. Here is one. It's the finals of the 2005 U.S. Open, Federer serving to Andre Agassi early in the fourth set. There's a medium-long exchange of groundstrokes, one with the distinctive butterfly shape of today's power-baseline game, Federer and Agassi yanking each other from side to side, each trying to set up the baseline winner...until suddenly Agassi hits a hard heavy cross-court backhand that pulls Federer way out wide to his ad (=left) side, and Federer gets to it but slices the stretch backhand short, a couple feet past the service line, which of course is the sort of thing Agassi dines out on, and as Federer's scrambling to reverse and get back to center, Agassi's moving in to take the short ball on the rise, and he smacks it hard right back into the same ad corner, trying to wrong-foot Federer, which in fact he does -- Federer's still near the corner but running toward the centerline, and the ball's heading to a point behind him now, where he just was, and there's no time to turn his body around, and Agassi's following the shot in to the net at an angle from the backhand side...and what Federer now does is somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward three or four steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of his backhand corner, all his weight moving backward, and the forehand is a topspin screamer down the line past Agassi at net, who lunges for it but the ball's past him, and it flies straight down the sideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of Agassi's side, a winner -- Federer's still dancing backward as it lands. And there's that familiar little second of shocked silence from the New York crowd before it erupts, and John McEnroe with his color man's headset on TV says (mostly to himself, it sounds like), ''How do you hit a winner from that position?'' And he's right: given Agassi's position and world-class quickness, Federer had to send that ball down a two-inch pipe of space in order to pass him, which he did, moving backwards, with no setup time and none of his weight behind the shot. It was impossible. It was like something out of ''The Matrix.'' I don't know what-all sounds were involved, but my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over the couch and I was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like novelty-shop eyeballs.", "headline": {"main": "Federer As Religious Experience", "kicker": "PLAY"}, "abstract": "Play column discusses innovation of Roger Federer, who some believe will change men's tennis forever; photos (L)", "print_page": "47", "word_count": 8891, "_id": "4fd2af3b8eb7c8105d89e61a", "snippet": "CORRECTION APPENDED     Almost anyone who loves tennis and follows the men's tour on television has, over the last few years, had what might be termed Federer Moments.

In the overall history of information science, this may seem like a leap from the 1890's to the late 1890's. But a classification system is like a shark. If it isn't moving forward, it's probably dead. Perhaps the most delightfully named branch of the federal bureaucracy is the Library of Congress Cataloging Directorate, which sounds oddly like an office of totalitarian librarians.

My wife gets angry at me for getting angry. The only solution is to get found. Recently, I rented a car in Kansas, a state that, in the eastern sections at least, is less gridlike than it looks.

So, on a whim, I asked for a car with a G.P.S. guidance system. I knew all about the technology behind G.P.S. -- the array of satellites overhead, the tracking stations, the reliance on minute differences in time to calculate position. I own an old G.P.S. that thinks the world is a blank gray slate on which you can trace your footsteps.

This year's event will also focus on the boom in electronic publishing, and Google Inc. is expected to be in the spotlight, since its efforts to make extracts of every book printed available online have prompted concerns with authors and publishers over copyright. Up All Night in Toronto Adventurous people of Toronto -- more than 400,000 of them -- stayed up and out on Saturday night and into Sunday morning at their first Nuit Blanche festival, which transformed the city into an art gallery, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. For 12 hours, beginning at 7:01 p.m. on Saturday, visitors attended more than 130 exhibits in galleries, churches and parks in what Mayor David Miller called ''an extraordinary night for the city.'' Toronto adopted the idea from Paris, where the first Nuit Blanche was held in October 2002. The event has since spread to Rome; Madrid; Naples, Italy; and Riga, Latvia. This year's Parisian version starts at sundown on Oct. 7. Woes for George Michael The British singer George Michael was arrested over the weekend when London police found him slumped over the wheel of his car and in possession of cannabis, Reuters reported. ''At about 3.22 a.m. on Sunday morning officers were informed of a stationary vehicle with a driver inside causing an obstruction,'' a police spokesman said. Mr. Michael, 43, was arrested in February this year in a scenario that was almost exactly the same as last weekend's. The singer's partner, Kenny Goss, told reporters Sunday night that Mr. Michael had no comment about the arrest. ''He's fine and I've got him a McDonald's,'' Mr. Goss said. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in Print: Learn From a Master In ''The Joy of Opera,'' scheduled for publication in 2009, the renowned tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, below, will offer insights into masterpieces and how opera works -- and can be enjoyed -- on both sides of the curtain, Reuters reported. ''Opera for so many people remains a mystery, a curious and strange art form, when it really should be much more part of our everyday lives,'' Mr. Domingo writes in the book, according to the publisher W. W. Norton, which has acquired the worldwide rights. Mr. Domingo, 65, is the general director of both the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera and continues to perform and conduct. Footnotes Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman are both slated to direct productions for the Sydney Theater Company in Australia in 2007. Ms. Blanchett's production of ''Blackbird,'' by David Harrower, will be her directorial debut. The actor Stephen Rea (''The Crying Game'') and the director Garry Hynes (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') will be among the participants in an Irish Theater Symposium at Princeton University Oct. 13 to 15, featuring discussions, readings and performances reflecting on Ireland's long theatrical history. The Very End The results of a survey released yesterday indicate that James Blunt's ''Goodbye My Lover'' is the song most requested at British funerals and remembrance services, with Robbie Williams's ''Angels'' coming in second. The survey, sponsored by The Bereavement Register, which removes from databases the names and addresses of people who have died, found that 51 percent of respondents ask for a specific song to be played at their funeral, and that 79 percent have talked with family and friends about possible choices. Some choices were ambiguous, though. Is it the deceased or someone left behind whom we are to imagine singing the words of the No. 9 song, Police's ''Every Breath You Take''? It includes the lyrics ''Every move you make/Every step you take/I'll be watching you.''", "headline": {"main": "Arts, Briefly"}, "abstract": "Annual Frankfurt book fair will focus on flourishing literary scene in India; 70 of India's most successful writers, including Amitav Ghosh and Kiran Desai, are scheduled to present their work; photo (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 756, "_id": "4fd278ec8eb7c8105d83b45a", "snippet": " Book Fair to Honor India  The annual Frankfurt book fair, the world's largest, begins tomorrow and will focus on the flourishing literary scene in India, this year's guest of honor country, as well as the rise of the Internet as a challenge to the...", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0D91430F930A35753C1A9609C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DESAI, KIRAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GHOSH, AMITAV"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "INDIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FRANKFURT BOOK FAIR"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Steven", "lastname": "McElroy"}], "original": "Compiled by Steven McElroy"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-10-03T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.", "headline": {"main": "This Is Only A Test?", "kicker": "The Learning Network"}, "abstract": "In this lesson, students learn about North Korea's October, 2006, plans to conduct its first nuclear test.

Over the weekend, Edmund Daukoru of Nigeria, the president of OPEC, called the drop in crude oil prices since July ''catastrophic.'' Although the 11 members of OPEC seem to agree on the need to rid world markets of excess oil, the situation gets a bit stickier from there, with countries like Iran and Venezuela vying with bigger producers like Saudi Arabia and Algeria for market share. TOWARD A BETTER CANAL -- Panamanians will vote in a referendum over whether to add a third set of locks to the Panama Canal (Sunday). The country took over the canal from the United States in 1999, and although there seems to be broad agreement that the project would help bring the outdated canal up to modern standards -- making room for larger ships, for instance, and cutting wait times for vessels lingering offshore -- many Panamanians are skeptical. There is concern, among other things, that the government's $5.2 billion price tag for the seven-year project is a low estimate. Meanwhile, Nicaragua's president has proposed spending $18 billion to build a wider alternative to the Panama Canal.

Now there's ''Jazz Icons,'' a DVD series produced by Reelin' in the Years and culled from vintage European television broadcasts. The first nine releases hold many delights -- a magnificent Ella Fitzgerald, a crisp Quincy Jones big band -- but none more thrilling than a concert by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in Brussels in 1958. It is the only known film of the short-lived version of the band that was assembled by the tenor saxophonist Benny Golson and included Mr. Golson's fellow Philadelphians Lee Morgan on trumpet, Bobby Timmons on piano and Jymie Merritt on bass. A month earlier, Blue Note Records had issued their landmark album, ''Moanin','' and Morgan, playing the title track in Belgium, begins and ends his solo with the same tart phrases he used on the recording. He looks and sounds brilliant, like everyone else in the band. From start to finish, though, this is Blakey's show; somewhere in the climax of ''A Night in Tunisia,'' he plays emphatically enough to collapse one of his cymbal stands. There could hardly be a better capstone to the concert, which furthers the case for the 1958 Jazz Messengers as one of the fiercest groups of the hard-bop era. 120 Days This Norwegian band has a new self-titled debut on Vice Records, licensed from the Oslo label Smalltown Supersound. But the sound of 120 Days will not be especially foreign to anyone who can imagine a contemporary gloss on Kraftwerk, or a keyboard-heavy take on the dance-punk of DFA Records. The album's lyrics, sung in a straining voice by Adne Meisfjord, are in English. They tend toward clich\u00e9, but that's beside the point. ''Come Out (Come Down, Fade Out, Be Gone),'' the opening track, is much more noteworthy for its nine-minute sonic odyssey than for its message, which is fairly well articulated by the title. The same could be said for the album, an exercise in deep focus that achieves its aims through subtle manipulation. Ron Miles The trumpeter Ron Miles is a shadow on the margins of the jazz mainstream -- outside his home base in Denver, he's best known as a sideman with the guitarist Bill Frisell -- but that doesn't mean he lacks a clear concept as a bandleader or composer. ''Stone/Blossom'' is his third release for the Sterling Circle label (available through sterlingcircle.com), and it's actually two good albums, each with a different band. ''Stone'' features a standard rhythm section and seven original songs that often unravel into calm, melodious abstraction. ''Blossom'' is a good deal sunnier: it opens with a guitar arpeggio that briefly suggests the Mamas and the Papas. It so happens that the album includes two pop covers from roughly the same era, ''I Woke Up in Love This Morning,'' a Partridge Family hit, and ''I'll Be There,'' recorded by the Jackson 5, and neither feels remotely like a gag. Mr. Miles plays them with poise, and his seven-piece ensemble, rich with keyboards and guitars, gives off a luminous haze. Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, Roscoe Mitchell Conceived and centered in Chicago but well represented in New York and elsewhere, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians has always encompassed a wider breadth of styles than its de facto flagship, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, could ever manage alone. ''Streaming,'' a new album on Pi Recordings, documents a three-way conversation between the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams (the movement's patriarch), the multireedist Roscoe Mitchell (of Art Ensemble renown) and the trombonist George Lewis (of Columbia University tenure). Their interaction runs deep, even in the plentiful stretches of the album unattached to any tempo or key. There are jingling bells, creaky drones, birdlike twitters, roomy pauses; there are also moments of startling clarity. The full effect registers only when the album is experienced whole. Squarepusher ''Hello Everything,'' the title of Squarepusher's latest effort for Warp Records, could be read to imply either Zenlike openness or kitchen-sink clutter. Given the track record of Squarepusher, the electronic auteur also known as Tom Jenkinson, you'd have reason to suspect the clutter. Thankfully the only track that bears out that suspicion is ''The Modern Bass Guitar,'' a hyperactive tangle of beats and bleeps. The rest of the album is less twitchy, with crescendos that come on gradually and melodies that threaten to stick. Perhaps ''Hello Everything'' is not Mr. Jenkinson's most inventive work, but it's among his most tuneful, and the occasional splashes of jazz-funk offer a welcome dose of organic imprecision. He even manages to rein in his modern bass guitar technique, while dropping hints that it's there. Prince The producers of ''Happy Feet,'' an animated children's film that Warner Brothers is releasing in November, wanted a scene in which two emperor penguins sing ''Kiss,'' by Prince. (From the looks of the trailer, the movie involves much singing and dancing, and an awful lot of penguins.) The artist withheld permission but puckered up with a new tune, ''Song of the Heart,'' that began streaming earlier this month on music.aol.com. ''Step aside, little babies,'' he chirps, perhaps addressing any haters in his new demographic, ''and watch me do my thing.'' He's riding a lite-funk beat, and there's a likable horn interlude. But the track begs the question: What do we need less in 2006, another cute penguin movie or another glib, desultory Prince song?", "headline": {"main": "Vintage Jazz and Contemporary Keyboards", "kicker": "MUSIC: PLAYLIST"}, "abstract": "Nate Chinen reviews six new CD's; photo (M)", "print_page": "27", "word_count": 910, "_id": "4fd254028eb7c8105d7fabfb", "snippet": "Reviews of new releases by Art Blakey; 120 Days; Ron Miles; Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis and Roscoe Mitchell; Squarepusher and Prince.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/arts/music/15play.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2006/10/15/arts/15play.751.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2006/10/15/arts/15play.751.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PRINCE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ABRAMS, MUHAL RICHARD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MITCHELL, ROSCOE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LEWIS, GEORGE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BLAKEY, ART"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRISELL, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROCK MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAZZ"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (AUDIO)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Nate", "lastname": "Chinen"}], "original": "By Nate Chinen"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-10-15T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "The City Weekly Desk", "lead_paragraph": "NEW YORK has always been in the forefront of independent film.

The move represents a large step for Wal-Mart's strategy in China, allowing it to more than double its presence there. [A1.] WAL-MART DEMONSTRATION -- In a rare demonstration, more than 100 Wal-Mart employees rallied at a store in Hialeah Gardens, Fla., to protest a new policy on employee absences, as well as efforts at the store to cut workers' hours. [C9.] DISNEY SETS FOOD STANDARDS -- Walt Disney, addressing the growing concerns of parents over child nutrition, said it would curtail use of its name and characters with food items that did not meet new nutritional standards. [C1.] INDIAN ENGINEERS' CREDENTIALS -- In India -- once regarded as a bottomless well of low-cost, ready-to-work, English-speaking engineers -- a shortage looms. At issue is the engineers' competence: a study commissioned by a trade group, the National Association of Software and Service Companies, or Nasscom, found only one in four engineering graduates to be employable. [A1.] PAYPAL'S OFFSPRING -- Since 2002, when dozens of employees left PayPal after it was bought by eBay, those workers have gone on to start or join a new generation of Internet companies and other ventures. They include YouTube, the Web video company that Google has agreed to acquire for $1.65 billion. [C1.] TRAVELING IN STYLE -- In the latest in a series of big, long-haul airliners to be converted to private jets, Lufthansa Technik is to introduce a design based on the Boeing 787. It calls for 35 seats, in a plane that will seat 210 to 330 as a commercial airliner. [C1.] UNITEDHEALTH OPTIONS -- In the wake of the announcement that William R. McGuire is leaving the UnitedHealth Group as chairman and chief executive, an options grant made years ago to the new chief executive, Stephen J. Hemsley, is raising questions. [C1.] CRIME'S COST -- Years of rampant violent crime is not only robbing Latin America of significant private investment, but in some cases is also stealing up to 8 percent from national economic growth, economists and World Bank officials say. [C1.] EX-F.D.A. HEAD CHARGED -- Lester M. Crawford, the former Food and Drug Administration chief who resigned abruptly in September 2005, was charged with lying about stock he and his wife owned in companies the agency regulates, including PepsiCo and the Sysco Corporation. He is expected to enter a guilty plea in federal court today. [A15.] LAW TRIPS UP WOULD-BE BRIDES -- A law intended to protect women from potential abuse by American men who seek brides from other countries has led to freezes on some visa applications for foreign fianc\u00e9es. [A14.] SUN 'DATA CENTER' -- Sun Microsystems has developed a novel ''data center in a box,'' based on a standard 20-foot shipping container, in an effort to transform the fundamental economics of corporate computing. The company is to unveil a prototype today. [C3.] DOW CLOSES IN ON 12,000 -- Wall Street extended its record-setting advance, sending the Dow Jones industrial average within a whisper of 12,000. The Dow closed up 20.09 points at 11,980.60. [C12.] TRUCK MAKER MAKES ACQUISITION -- The Oshkosh Truck Corporation, a military and commercial vehicle maker, said it had agreed to buy JLG Industries, a maker of aerial work platforms and booms, for about $3 billion. [C4.] RUSSIAN OIL LICENSES AT RISK -- In a sign of continuing turmoil in the oil industry in Russia, the government threatened to revoke oil field licenses held by the country's largest private energy concern, Lukoil. The environmental regulator behind the action, Oleg L. Mitvol, above, suspended a permit last month for a project operated by Royal Dutch Shell. [C11.] SOLAR POWERED -- Google said it would build a massive solar electricity system to provide about 30 percent of the electricity used each day at its one-million-square-foot office complex. [C8.] TITLE INSURANCE REPORT -- Washington state regulators said title insurance companies there flouted laws by spending thousands of dollars on pro basketball tickets, shopping trips, cocktail parties, boat trips and golf tournaments, in exchange for customer referrals. [C3.] ONLINE NEW ERA OF FILMMAKING -- Sharon Waxman of The Times talks with executives from Imagemetrics, a special-effects company whose new facial mapping software could change the way movies are made, in a multimedia report at nytimes.com/technology. TRYING E-BOOKS, AGAIN -- The new Sony Reader distinguishes itself from all the other failed e-book readers with its sleek, portable screen. David Pogue reports at nytimes.com/technology. ENERGY GRAB IN RUSSIA -- The Russian government has accused Western energy companies of damaging the environment on Sakhalin Island, but oil analysts say the allegations are economically motivated. A multimedia report is at nytimes.com/business. MANAGING GLOBALIZATION -- Daniel Altman, the International Herald Tribune's global economics correspondent, offers a look at the day's news, at nytimes.com/business.

Instead of speeding toward the nearest car wash, hoping that no one notices the ''present'' deposited on the hood or windshield, a driver can use the kit to remove the offending lump quickly and effectively. The product's slogan, penned by Grumpy Girl's owner, Allison Takeshita, is thus a model of reassurance: ''Go ahead. Park under that shady tree. Everything is going to be just fine.''", "headline": {"main": "That Clump On Your Car Has Met Its Match", "kicker": "OPENERS: THE GOODS"}, "abstract": "Honolulu-based company Grumpy Girl sells kit that is intended to make it easier to clean bird droppings from vehicles; kit costs $28.95; photos (M)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 624, "_id": "4fd271a88eb7c8105d82dd0f", "snippet": "An emergency car kit to cope with bird droppings offers drivers this assurance: \u201cGo ahead.

TRADE STATISTICS, ANYONE? -- The Commerce Department is scheduled to release trade deficit figures for September on Thursday. Economists expect that the number will drop a bit, thanks in part to a decline in crude oil prices. In August, the deficit reached a record $69.9 billion, swollen by high oil imports. The forthcoming figure is expected to be $65 billion, economists say. Also on Thursday, the Commerce Department will issue its report on import and export prices for October, which could offer insight on inflation trends. AIRING THE OPTIONS -- The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company,the French and German company that owns Airbus, will hold a board meeting to discuss possible plans to develop the A350 XWB, or extra-wide body, aircraft (Tuesday).

A1 The death penalty for Mr. Hussein and two of his co-defendants brought jubilation to Shiite and Kurdish neighborhoods across Iraq, gloom to Sunni ones, and a political blessing for its current, embattled prime minister. A11 Taiwan's Leader Admits Lies President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan admitted he submitted false receipts for reimbursement from public funds and lied to prosecutors about how he spent the money, but said he had done so in the interest of national security. A6 China Sets African Trade Deals China and a number of African nations agreed on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa. A6 Nicaraguans Vote for Leader Nicaraguans went to the polls to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s. A8 Israel Firm on Gaza Offensive Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said the military would not halt its offensive in the northern Gaza Strip until Palestinian rocket fire toward Israel was reduced. A11 Snag for Kosovo Independence The hopes of ethnic Albanians that Kosovo would be granted independence by the end of this year were placed in doubt as Secretary General Kofi Annan said a decision on the future of the United Nations-administered province could be delayed. A8 Turk Hints at Freer Speech Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey signaled he was prepared to amend a law limiting free speech, a surprise move that was apparently an 11th-hour attempt to prevent a crisis with the European Union over Turkey's troubled membership talks. A8 NATIONAL A12-19 G.O.P. Finds Issues For Rallying Its Voters President Bush seized on the sentencing of Saddam Hussein as a ''milestone'' in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign. The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics. A1 Campaigning Coast to Coast To inspire his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose reputation as a maverick makes him an appealing attraction. A17 In one of the tightest races in the country, Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, an important economic concern, high gasoline prices, has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down. A17 A new poll, which queried 400 likely voters and was published by The Miami Herald, found that 49 percent said they preferred the Democratic challenger, State Senator Ron Klein, to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. , who drew the support of 40 percent of respondents. A17 As volunteers lined up to carry the last paper sacks of leaflets into a web of suburbs to the west of Chicago, Iraq loomed over the tense race for the Congressional seat that is being vacated by Henry J. Hyde, a Republican. A17 Many Candidates Unopposed Though the Democrats need only 15 seats to take control of the House, 34 House candidates (30 Democrats and 4 Republicans) have no opponent at all. A16 Minister Asks for Forgiveness Thousands of people gathered at the Colorado Springs church whose founder, Ted Haggard, was dismissed for ''sexually immoral conduct.'' Speakers urged the church's members to find a way forward without recrimination or bitterness; a letter from Mr. Haggard was read from the 8,000-seat auditorium's center stage, urging forgivness for the Denver man who broke the story. A12 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Final Political Push Is Felt By Voters in New Jersey Volunteers bounded from door to door, the airwaves filled with advertisements and carefully chosen political celebrities popped up across New Jersey as the state became a battlefield for both parties in the final days of the midterm campaign. With Democrats appearing within reach of gaining the six seats they need to take control of the United States Senate, New Jersey has become a focus of national attention. B1 State Republicans Cry Foul Anticipating historic political losses in New York on Election Day, state Republican leaders are lashing out at the national party in Washington, saying it has exploited New York donors and missed opportunities against a prime target, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. They say that, despite pleas for help, they have been ignored in Washington. B1 Cigarette Trade in Jeopardy The tax-free sale of steeply discounted cigarettes by the Shinnecock Indian Outpost in Southampton is what keeps the tribe alive. But now the cigarette trade is being threatened by both a federal lawsuit and an expected push by the New York State government, which estimates it loses $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes. B1 Brooklyn Development Faulted Even in Greenpoint-Williamsburg, an area familiar with growth and gentrification, the sweeping changes wrought by the city's rezoning have left many residents feeling dizzied, and there is a sense that the government has not moved fast enough to keep pace with developers. B1 Neediest Cases B6 ARTS E1-10 Students Build in Mississippi Architects in training at Parsons the New School for Design volunteered for six weeks of rugged work in hurricane-ravaged Mississippi, conceiving and building a combination information center and laundromat. E1 World War II Photos Unearthed Close to 800 images by the photographer Dorothea Lange depicting the World War II-era internment of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens have been unearthed in the National Archives, where they had lain neglected for a half-century after being impounded by the government. E1 BUSINESS DAY C1-10 Medicare and Democrats Democrats, who have long charged that the drug industry is profiteering at taxpayers' expense, say they want to introduce legislation to revoke the law that bars Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug makers like Pfizer for the medicines it buys.

Late one afternoon in September, just before dinner, that's the sort of conversation I had with Tom Rothman at his office on the 20th Century Fox lot. Rothman and his partner, Jim Gianopulos, serve as co-chairmen of Fox Filmed Entertainment; together, they have had an especially profitable run of comedies over the past few years, most recently including ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' which this year took in $125 million at the domestic box office. As Rothman put it, ''Comedies have been very good to us.'' To prove his point, he began rummaging through some low shelves outside his office that were cluttered with awards. They weren't Oscars but angular statuettes known as Gold Reels, given by a movie-tracking service, Nielsen EDI, to a studio when one of its films reaches $100 million in domestic box-office receipts. '' 'Dodgeball'!'' Rothman said triumphantly when he found the award for the movie, which starred Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. That one cost $18 million to make, he pointed out, and earned $114 million domestically. ''And here's 'Something About Mary,' '' he said, dusting off the inscription before handing me the bulky statuette. ''There's Something About Mary,'' which Rothman considers an early source for the style, appeal and eccentricity of contemporary Hollywood comedies, cost $20 million. It earned $176 million domestically.

E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C4.] LIFE IN THE STUDIO -- In an era when producers, directors and popular actors are required to toe a stricter line, even Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is feeling the squeeze. His contribution to Disney cannot be underestimated. He has produced 17 films for the studio since 1991. They have brought in $5 billion. As part of a shift under Robert A. Iger, the new Disney chief executive, the studio pledged to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the company's businesses. That means Mr. Bruckheimer is now in the onscreen amusement park business. [C1.] MOVING ON AFTER XBOX -- The hoopla was still swelling around November's debut of the Xbox 360, when some on its development team began conceiving a new product. Tomorrow, after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release the result of that research: the Zune. At a glance, it looks like yet another aspiring iPod rival. But the Zune can do something that no other player can claim: it can locate other Zune players and wirelessly exchange content with a few touches of a big shiny button. [C1.] MUSIC FILLS THE AIR -- The upscale department store Nordstrom, which has taken a chance on up-and-coming designers, is now betting on a different set of rising stars: musicians. Beginning this holiday season, the retailer will develop and sell a collection of CDs that, over time, is expected to rival the one carried by Starbucks, its corporate neighbor in Seattle. [C11.] TAKING A NEW PATH -- Two big advertisers known for following traditional ways of marketing products are expanding their efforts to become a little less conventional. Both, coincidentally, share the same creative and media agencies, which are also trying to demonstrate their eagerness to explore the brave world of new media. The advertisers are the General Electric Company and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. The agencies are both part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO Worldwide in New York for the creative parts of the campaigns and OMD for the media elements. Everyone on Madison Avenue ''is looking to push the envelope, find what is going to be the next big thing,'' said Jennifer Gordineer, group director for national investment on the PepsiCo account at OMD. Advertising, Stuart Elliott. [C8.] GETTING A SECOND CHANCE -- Even adults, it seems, are getting a little sick of their childhoods, long after everyone else has. So TV Land, the network best-known for reruns of ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' is unveiling programming to appeal to what the network sees as one of the next obsessions for baby boomers: optimism about having second careers and changing lifestyles. Having recently produced reality shows with Farrah Fawcett and Mr. T, the network, which is owned by Viacom, is now turning its cameras on George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion-turned-grill purveyor. [C10.] FINANCING FOR ETHANOL -- The Mascoma Corporation, a company that is trying to produce ethanol from nontraditional sources, has received $30 million from a group of prominent venture capital investors. The investment, which is led by General Catalyst Partners, and includes Khosla Ventures, Flagship Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and others, is the latest in a string of venture capital financings of alternative energy companies.

After being out for two months, he will play two games in four days. Damon Huard will return to the bench. The Chiefs (5-4) play Denver next Thursday night. VIKINGS' FULLBACK IS OUT -- Struggling on offense, the Minnesota Vikings have likely lost fullback Tony Richardson for the rest of the season. Richardson fractured his forearm Sunday against Green Bay. He entered the game with a broken thumb. The arm injury will probably keep Richardson out for six weeks, and there are just seven games left. SOCCER JAMAICA HIRES MILUTINOVIC -- Bora Milutinovic has signed a four-year contract to coach Jamaica's national soccer team and try to lift the Reggae Boyz back to the World Cup. Milutinovic, a 62-year-old Serb, is the only man to have coached five different nations to the World Cup finals. He is set to make $1 million. Milutinovic reached the finals with Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990, the United States in 1994, Nigeria in 1998 and China in 2002. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE) COLLEGE FOOTBALL PATERNO INDUCTION RESCHEDULED -- Joe Paterno, who returned to practice for the first time since breaking his shin and injuring knee ligaments during a sideline collision with players on Nov. 4 at Wisconsin, would have missed his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame on Dec. 5. Doctors told Paterno to stay off his feet for at least five more weeks, so his induction was moved to Dec. 2007, Hall of Fame officials said yesterday. HEFTY BUYOUT FOR JEFF BOWDEN -- Jeff Bowden, the Florida State offensive coordinator, received a $537,000 buyout from the university's boosters to resign. Bowden -- the youngest son of Coach Bobby Bowden -- retains his $141,000 salary until his contract expires next August. He then will receive annual payments of $107,500 until August 2012. Jeff Bowden had been under fire for the past several years as Florida State's offense declined. His father has defended his performance. HOCKEY N.H.L. ON YOUTUBE -- The online video company YouTube said yesterday that it would show short clips of N.H.L. games in its first agreement with a professional sports league. YouTube, whose $1.65 billion purchase by Google was completed on Tuesday, said its users would be able to watch daily clips of two to five minutes from the N.H.L. for the 2006-7 season starting this month. YouTube said it was in talks with other sports organizations for similar offerings. Under the deal, YouTube will help identify and remove illegally posted N.H.L. clips as well as share revenue from advertising placed next to the content. The N.H.L. will also have its own dedicated Web channel on the site. (REUTERS) AUTO RACING MONTOYA TO MAKE NEXTEL DEBUT -- Juan Pablo Montoya will attempt to make his Nextel Cup debut Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway in the No. 30 Dodge. The car's owner, Chip Ganassi, had considered putting Montoya in the No. 42 Dodge, which is driven by Casey Mears and is guaranteed a spot in the field. The No. 30 is not, and Montoya will have to qualify the car to get into the race. GOLF WIE TO PLAY SONY OPEN -- Michelle Wie will play in the 2007 Sony Open in Hawaii, her seventh attempt to make the 36-hole cut in a United States PGA Tour event. Wie, 17, was given an exemption by Sony Corp., one of her sponsors, that allows her to play in the tournament without qualifying. She has played in the Sony Open in her home state the past three years. The Sony Open is the PGA Tour's second event, scheduled for Jan. 11-14 at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu.

Behind the News -- Founded eight years ago in a Silicon Valley garage by two Stanford University graduate students, Google went public two years ago at $85 a share. The company now ranks as one of America's 15 largest companies, joining the likes of Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart. Its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, both 33, are each worth roughly $17 billion. And Google keeps expanding. It recently bought YouTube, the video-sharing site, for $1.65 billion in stock, and is investing billions in research, computers and a global communications network. Some analysts expect the stock price to reach $600 next year. Yahoo. A RECORD BUYOUT The News -- In the biggest leveraged buyout in history, the Blackstone Group, a private investment firm, agreed to acquire Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest office-building owner and manager, for about $36 billion. Behind the News -- The deal eclipses the $33 billion paid earlier this year for H.C.A., the hospital chain, and will make Blackstone one of the nation's largest owners of real estate. The trust, with interests in 580 buildings and 108.6 million square feet of office space, will go from being a publicly held company to a private one. Samuel Zell, the real estate tycoon who founded Equity Office, told The Associated Press that Blackstone's offer was unsolicited. ''We got what we considered to be a significant offer at a price that we considered to be very attractive, and responded accordingly,'' he said. His stake could bring him $800 million. BONANZA ON WALL STREET The News -- The average weekly pay for financial sector jobs in Manhattan was $8,323 in the first quarter of 2006, up more than $3,000 per week in just three years, according to data collected by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Behind the News -- New York's dependence on Wall Street continues to grow. The 280,000 workers in the financial sector collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, but hold less than one in six of the 1.8 million jobs in the borough, according to the data. The good news on Wall Street may not be so good for others who live in New York. Michael L. Dolfman, the bureau's regional commissioner, said one consequence of the unequal distribution of income gains is that ''the middle class is being squeezed out of the city because of the tremendous purchasing power of the people in the global sectors of the economy.'' AN EYE ON THE WEALTHY The News -- The Internal Revenue Service reported a sharp increase in the number of tax audits for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and warned high earners that they will continue to face scrutiny in the coming year. Behind the News -- One of every 16 taxpayers who earned $1 million or more faced audits last year, a 33 percent increase over the previous year. The agency also audited 257,000 taxpayers with incomes over $100,000, an increase of 18 percent and the most in more than a decade. Over all, nearly 1.3 million individual returns were audited. . The I.R.S. commissioner, Mark W. Everson, said the agency would continue to investigate high-income taxpayers to maintain ''faith'' in the system. ''If you earn more than $100,000 or you're a millionaire,'' he said, ''you're a lot more likely to be audited these days than just a few years ago.'' A VICTORY FOR JANITORS The News -- Ending a monthlong strike, the union representing 5,300 janitors in Houston and the city's major cleaning firms reached a tentative contract that raises their wages by nearly 50 percent over two years and provides them health coverage. Behind the News -- The organizing of the janitors last year by the Service Employees International Union was hailed by the labor movement as a major victory. The contract would gradually raise wages, which now average $5.25 an hour, to $7.75 by Jan. 1, 2009. The employers agreed to increase a janitor's typical shift to six hours a day, from four, and to provide health coverage. For a 30-hour week, a janitor would earn $232.50 in the final year, about $12,000 a year. ''It's a moment of great victory,'' said Mercedes Herrera, a janitor for five years who earns $5.15 an hour.
