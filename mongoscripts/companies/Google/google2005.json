A ''hike'' in the Caribbean is not that annoyingly long distance between your hotel room and the beach. True, that's as far as most people want to go before flopping down on the sand and soaking up the sun. But there is actually serious hiking in the islands, from the 10,000-foot scramble up Pico Duarte in the Dominican Republic, the highest point in the Caribbean, to lowland trails through the gardens of St. Kitts. I wanted something in between, and after a few Google searches (typing in ''hiking'' and ''Caribbean'' turns up roughly 908,000 results) and flicking through some guidebooks, it seemed like all arrows pointed to the trek to Boiling Lake, a mysterious bubbling caldron deep in the jungles of Dominica, probably one of the least visited Caribbean islands and a bit of a mystery itself. So the minute after my girlfriend and I landed in Dominica a few weeks ago, we got into a cab and asked the taxi driver how was Boiling Lake. ''It stopped boiling.'' No, really. ''I'm not pulling your leg, brother. It stopped boiling last week,'' said James, the driver. ''Specialists come to the island. They look at lake. They take samples. But water went away. No one knows why.'' I then asked about the island's most famous and unusual delicacy -- the giant two-pound frog known as the mountain chicken. ''No, man,'' James said. ''Hard to find anymore.'' Great, I thought, a 1,977-mile, 10-hour trip and no Boiling Lake and no mountain chicken. Dominica, it turns out, is the island of surprises -- but in the best way. It is a hiker's paradise, a mountainous, velvety green lump in the middle of the ocean, 29-by-16-miles small, with gorgeous uncut rain forest and the last intact Carib Indian territory. It's never been your typical Caribbean island. When the first Europeans stepped ashore in the 15th century, they were confused because the native men spoke one language and the native women another. For the next few centuries, Dominica remained off the beaten track, a refuge to runaway slaves and too mountainous for the sprawling sugar cane plantations that came to dominate the rest of the West Indies. Today, Dominica (pronounced dahm-uh-NEE-kuh) is one of the smallest countries in the world, population 71,000, 15 degrees north of the Equator, and southeast of the much bigger Dominican Republic, which it often gets confused with. There are few beaches, few tourists, no big hotels and no tiki-lighted limbo contests. But there is a lot of rain. Each year the island gets a whopping 300-plus inches, and the day we landed it was pouring. As we drove to Roseau, the capital, we saw results of this: an incredible fertility, with the hillsides carpeted in a million shades of green and grove after grove of fruit trees -- oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, six varieties of bananas, papayas, guavas, star fruit, breadfruit, passion fruit -- all dangling along the road, the fruit nearly scraping our windshield as we passed. Driving through Dominica was like driving through a ripe, juicy tropical fruit salad. Beyond were stunning green mountain peaks, some as high as 4,700 feet. Legend has it that when Christopher Columbus was asked to describe Dominica to the queen of Spain, he crumpled up a piece of paper and threw it onto the table. That's how mountainous and textured the island was. Columbus eventually learned why the native men and women spoke different tongues: the fierce Carib Indians, who had conquered the islands, exterminated all the indigenous Arawak men but spared the Arawak women, who continued to speak their own language. Today, everyone speaks English (Dominica, a former British colony, gained independence in 1978) and the island is calm, with a growing economy based on eco-tourism and bananas. But some places look a little run-down. And our first hotel was one of them. The Web site for the Roseau Valley Hotel advertised tranquillity, nature and ''deluxe rooms.'' Instead, we were given a unit overlooking a busy road with headlamps shining in our windows. There were mouse droppings in our bathtub. A worm slithered out of the drain. It was a good lesson not to rely solely on the Internet. (We lasted one night.) The one thing the hotel did provide, however, was an excellent hiking guide, Peter Green. Granted, his safari outfit with the hand-painted waterfalls on it and cellphone number written on his chest might have been a little much. But Peter was incredibly knowledgeable about all things, well, green. And he knew the way to Boiling Lake. ''O.K., guys, let's get physical,'' Peter said as we set off into the forest on our seven-hour hike. The sun disappeared above the canopy and we soon found ourselves in a cool, dimly lighted world. The vegetation was incredible: 125-foot-tall gommier or ''gummy gum'' trees; jungle vines dangling like tentacles; spongy pillows of moss that we put our fists through; huge, waxy elephant ears with dime-size raindrops sliding off them. The best part was that unlike most other jungles, there were no dangerous animals lying beneath the trees. The fiercest creature here is the yellow land crab, one of which tried to pinch me as I stepped through a stream (it missed). As we hiked, we played Tarzan and swung from vines, sailing over mud puddles and watching the forest rush past us. We watched hummingbirds drink from lavender morning glories. Peter peeled cool, delicious oranges for snacks. The trail was perfectly marked and well cleared and sometimes aided by logs in the ground that functioned as steps. The best of them were scored with X's for grip. But it was tough trekking. All of us -- me, my girlfriend, Courtenay, and even Peter, a native Dominican -- were often panting. There are really two types of hiking in this world: heads up or heads down. Heads up means the conditions are good, the trail is smooth and you can scan the treetops for birds or gaze off into the misty distance. Heads down means you ain't looking at nothing. Except your own two feet and where to put them next. This was clearly heads-down hiking. As we cleared the top of a ridge, we caught a whiff of rotten eggs: sulfur. We shivered a bit as the sweat cooled on our bodies. We were close, with just one last stretch to go, called the Valley of Desolation. Dominica is a volcanic island (there was an eruption in 1997), and the Valley of Desolation is filled with bubbling mineral pools and frothy, milky rivers and steam shooting out of the earth. Finally we cleared the last pebbly slope and peered down into Boiling Lake. ''Unbelievable,'' Peter said. Boiling Lake, apparently, is a shadow of itself, a muddy gray pool only half full with a few bubbles here, a few gurgles there. We were told that before, you could actually see and hear it boiling like a kettle. Locals think an earthquake ruptured the bottom and caused the water to drain. It wasn't that big a deal to us because the hike had been so invigorating. But Peter was crushed. To him, it was like Old Faithful drying up. That night we stayed at the Papillote Wilderness Retreat, which was heavenly. The resort, which has only seven rooms, is nestled into the emerald hills and buffeted by sounds of crickets and frogs and the drumming of tropical rain. To make it even more perfect for the weary hiker, Papillote is built around natural hot springs. Ten lazy steps from our room was a little grotto with balmy waters that seeped into our skins and made us sleepy. Our room could be described as Caribbean chic, with louvered wooden windows and a big blue-green colors-of-the-ocean quilt on the bed. Dinner was excellent. I had tuna soaked in coconut milk wrapped in some type of jungle leaf, and Courtenay had chicken d'orange. They were accompanied by a kaleidoscope of tropical juices. The next few days we did a number of smaller, less ambitious hikes, just getting to know the island. And that's the thing about Dominica. You could easily spend a week here and not get bored. There's excellent scuba diving off the southern shore and hikes ranging from 15-minute forest strolls to the all-day climb of the island's tallest peak, Morne Diablotins, whose summit is reached by clinging to a curtain of jungle vines. The only gear you need for the hikes is a small backpack, a light rain jacket and a pair of hiking boots or running shoes. One morning we went to Middleham Falls, a 275-foot-high chute of foamy white water in the middle of the jungle. It takes about an hour to reach the falls from the road, and it is truly unforgettable to watch a river go flying off the side of a mountain, tumble through the air and then smash into a frothy pool of water so hard, so fast, that it sounds like a jet engine. Nearby is the Stinking Hole, a steaming fissure in the earth that belches out bitter fumes and is full of bat dung from all the furry winged creatures living inside. Needless to say, the Stinking Hole lives up to its name. We also spent an afternoon at Champagne Beach, a decidedly Dominican beach. For one, it was nearly deserted. And it was rocky, with the surf pounding the shore and making a rich, satisfying crunching sound as the waves sucked softball-size rocks into the sea and spat them back out. The best part was the bubbles. At the reef, volcanic hot springs along the ocean floor send up streams of tiny wobbling bubbles. Snorkeling through them was like swimming in a glass of Champagne. Our last night we stayed at another intimate resort, Beau Rive, which has six rooms, all with a prime view of the forest and the ocean. Mark Steele, the owner, came to the island from England 25 years ago and opened his hotel in 2003. ''It seemed like the real thing,'' he told us, as we lounged on the veranda. ''Dominica was the romantic version of the Caribbean. It was a place where the people hadn't turned into these cocktail-shaking stereotypes yet.'' As we looked across the wild green hills (and shook our cocktails), we agreed. Our little hike in the Caribbean didn't feel Caribbean at all. AT THE TRAIL'S END, QUIET INNS AND CREOLE FOOD The Dominica Tourist Office is at (888) 645-5637. There are no direct flights from the United States to Dominica. You connect through Antigua, Barbados, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia or St. Martin, and the trip ends up taking the better part of a day. The airlines that fly to Dominica are American Eagle, Air Cara\u00efbes, Caribbean Star and LIAT; round-trip fares from Kennedy start at about $600 with three stops and multiple airlines. WHERE TO STAY Dominica's hotels are not nearly as fancy as what you'll find on most other Caribbean islands, which is part of the draw. They're also very affordable. Papillote Wilderness Retreat, tucked into the emerald hillsides above Trafalgar village, is reason enough to go to the island. The seven-room nature lodge has its own hot springs and botanical garden; (767) 448- 2287 or www.papillote.dm. Double rooms are $110, plus tax and service charges, and daily breakfast and dinner are $35 a person. Another great choice is Beau Rive, a beautifully styled small inn run by an Englishman who is a jazz pianist. Beau Rive is on the wild eastern shores of Dominica, near Castle Bruce; (767) 445-8992 or www.beaurive.com. Doubles are $120, plus tax and service charges, and dinner $20 a person. There are also a number of midsize hotels in Roseau, the capital. The best known is the Fort Young Hotel; (767) 448-5000 or www.fortyounghotel.com. Doubles from $95, plus tax and service. WHERE TO EAT Most hotels, even smaller ones, offer delicious fresh food. Specialties include tropical fruits and marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna. Among the small Creole restaurants in Roseau is La Robe Creole on Victoria Street, (767) 448-2896. A dinner for two with wine is about $38. GUIDES You don't need one -- trails are very well marked and safe. But you'll get more out of hikes by going with someone who knows the land. Hotels can help make arrangements. We were very happy with Peter Green, who can be reached at (767) 235-2270, (767) 448-2366 or petergreentours@hotmail.com. He charges $100 a day for two.

Fryer Jr. is 27 years old and he is an assistant professor of economics at Harvard and he is black. Yes, 27 is young to be any kind of professor anywhere. But after what might charitably be called a slow start in the scholarly life, Fryer has been in a big hurry to catch up. He was in fact only 25 when he went on the job market, gaining offers from -- well, just about everywhere. He abruptly ended his job search by accepting an invitation to join the Society of Fellows at Harvard, one of academia's most prestigious research posts. This meant he wouldn't be teaching anywhere for three years. The Harvard economics department told Fryer to take its offer anyway; he could have an office and defer his teaching obligation until the fellowship was done. Now that he is halfway through his fellowship, the quality and breadth of Fryer's research have surprised even his champions. ''As a pure technical economic theorist, he's of the first rate,'' says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard. ''But what's really incredible is that he's also much more of a broad social theorist -- talking to psychologists, sociologists, behavioral geneticists -- and the ideas he comes up with aren't the 'let's take the standard economic model and push a little harder' ideas. He makes you think of Nathan Glazer or William Julius Wilson, but with economic rigor.'' Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard humanities scholar, says that Fryer is ''destined to be a star. I mean, he's a star already, just a baby star.

In 1994, when Andreessen was only 22, he and a high-tech veteran named Jim Clark created the Internet-browser company Netscape Communications. Two years later, there he was on the cover of Time, sitting barefoot on a golden throne, dressed in jeans and a rumpled black polo. The magazine cast him as the king of the ''golden geeks,'' a group that popularized the formerly novel notion of surfing the Web and, not incidentally, helped create a vision of Silicon Valley as a glittering gold field where the young, bright and vigorous could stake a claim and make themselves unimaginably wealthy before they even had the time to put up posters in their barely furnished apartments. The baby fat has melted from the face of Andreessen; now 33, he is tall and almost slim, with short hair, and he dresses more like a grown-up (crisp white dress shirt, brass-buttoned black blazer). America Online bought Netscape for $4 billion in stock in 1998, and Andreessen left to start a company called Loudcloud, which went public in 2001; he serves as its chairman (the company was renamed Opsware in 2002). Several years back, Fortune pegged Andreessen's net worth at roughly $500 million, but with a wink and a playful dance of his eyebrows he implies that he's worth much more than that. Still, he continues to fill up notebooks with ideas and sketched-out business plans for new companies.

It's also soared since the cease-fire and Israel's decision to withdraw from Gaza.

By David Budbill. (Copper Canyon, paper, $15.) Budbill belongs to the tradition in American letters inaugurated by Thoreau and continuing today in manifestations both benign (Wendell Berry) and malignant (Ted Kaczynski), wherein the writer abandons the cacophony of human society for a little paradise in the woods, but instead of quietly living out his days in smog-free solitude insists on coming to town (or writing an essay, or mailing a bomb) every few months to remind us of what a benighted existence we're living. Budbill's Walden, in Vermont, sounds like an enchanting place, with a ''lovely garden / sleeping quietly now under the snow,'' ''an evening grosbeak / perched on the topmost branch of the / fifty-foot-high white pine tree / here on the edge of the dooryard'' and days filled with reverie. Still, it seems presumptuous for Budbill to assume we'd want to crash his hermitage: ''So much silence / is frightening. Better not come here if you / don't want to fall in upon yourself. Better yet, / better not come here at all.'' Such moments are few, though. Budbill's frank self-awareness keeps him from sounding smug for long; he's quick to include himself among the benighted. When Budbill's on his mountain, he longs for the city, and vice versa. Fame, wealth and sex are false gods, he insists, but he hastens to add that he still, at times, craves all three. These are not new ideas -- a list of references in the book shows how strongly he's been influenced by the classical Chinese poets -- but they find fresh expression here, thanks to Budbill's good humor and gusto. Joel Brouwer TANTALUS IN LOVE. By Alan Shapiro. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) ''All the new thinking is about loss,'' begins Robert Hass's ''Meditation at Lagunitas,'' one of the bellwether poems of our climate. ''In this it resembles all the old thinking.'' Isn't it pretty to think so? Poetry of loss these days, however painful or redemptive, seems to take cold comfort in shutting out complexity, and the possibility there's something new under the sun. Shapiro is an eloquent example. In ''Tantalus in Love,'' he thinks incessantly of loss. A marriage fails, loved ones die, the clock steams pitilessly along; meanwhile, the quatrains run on time. Those who've encountered the author's seven previous collections will recognize the territory. Shapiro handles these universal subjects with acuity; he cuts his eyes at discreet domestic details and they cut back. The husband's lacerated rhapsodizing over his distant wife's foot-of-the-bed yoga practice, in the poem ''Anger,'' is to die for; you can't decide whom to like less, and that's what keeps the poem interesting. Such tightly framed tales of domesticity offer a sense of control parallel to Shapiro's formal facility, reducing and clarifying the poem's field of action in defense against an abysmal multiplicity of things. Who wouldn't, these days, want to imagine that the bedroom, even the unhappy one, is the true arena of our lives? Such strategic exclusions can go too far. ''Didn't someone say somewhere,'' he asks at the end of ''Anger,'' ''if you shot an arrow it would never / reach its target, since the distance could / be halved, and halved, and halved, ad infinitum?'' Yes, someone did: Zeno, as it happens. We all know this, Shapiro included; why pretend otherwise? An austerity program of the sensibilities is one thing; playing dumb amid classical philosophical references is quite another.

Rubin might have lifted the charge that I am incompetent when writing on sex from Google, the charge having been aired several times in reviews of my books in the Book Review. ''Buckley's sex scenes have always been vulgar and prudish simultaneously -- neat trick.'' If so neat, why not acclaimed? But they are also mystifying.

There is nothing that hints of brotherly love in the book. Rubin is capable of just plain getting things wrong. ''Gus . . . sleeps with the woman Oakes ends up proposing to.'' No, he doesn't. He tries to sleep with her (before Oakes's involvement) and is turned down. The reviewer closes down even on acts of imagination that sustain the narrative.

In the spy world, if a young American visitor undertakes an imposture as the son of a senior American visitor, he is going to call him Dad.

That is, this Detroit native and questing Christian, now living in Brooklyn, believes in every state's right to be the subject of a gentle, exhaustive album. His second offering in this monumental project, ''Illinois'' (Asthmatic Kitty), is a 22-song swing through Prairie State history. Of course, historical tidbits like the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, homesteader hardship and the relative debating talents of Lincoln and Douglas mostly provide a jump-off for self-reflection. A man of his times, the 30-year-old Mr. Stevens, above, is both a legitimate history buff and a Google tourist. He is imbued with an outward-looking, Copland-esque musical vision and a narcissistic idea of the surveyable self reminiscent of Walt Whitman, though his lyrics can have an emo overreach and his compositions tend to forge into the folksily baroque. But his quiet, assured voice and pained personal revelations keep things intimate. At his best, Mr. Stevens has our pleasure in mind, as when the humorously titled ''Come on, Feel the Illinoise'' slides out of its complex meter into a simpler rhythm. When Mr. Stevens's lyrical approach succeeds, as in his account of a friend's death from bone cancer, falling on Casimir Pulaski Day, it can be breathtaking. When it doesn't, it can be a trifle maddening, especially when the melody is indelible. An antifolk aria about John Wayne Gacy disingenuously turns a falsetto lament for the killer's victims into an inward-looking recrimination. But such indulgences are forgivable for an emotional cartographer who promises so much.

She lectures frequently and doesn't actually swear off interviews, but when we recently asked her to talk about herself, her first reaction was typical: ''Couldn't I wriggle out of this?'' Stasio is smart, funny and, even after 17 years of writing the Book Review's crime column, ''kind of passionate'' about what she does. ''I've always been analytical,'' she says. ''I loved algebra in school.'' So it's natural that she's less interested in writing ''thumbs up, thumbs down'' reviews than in figuring out why a book works -- or doesn't. She started out as a fan of classical puzzle mysteries, then fell for hard-boiled writers like Chandler and Hammett. These days, she's a particular champion of small-press mysteries, which are often foreign imports or reprints of classic novels from earlier eras. The mystery field continues to unfold new riches: ''There are so many moving parts, so many subgenres and categories, with new ones turning up all the time.'' In a special essay this week, she turns her attention to one of the newest -- what's come to be known as the chick-lit mystery.

A1 U.S. General on Rebuilding Iraq An American general who commanded 38,000 soldiers in the securing and rebuilding of Baghdad writes in a new essay that success in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by training local security forces.

A11 Split Over Confirmation Tactics Before senators begin questioning the Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts Jr., the debate over his confirmation is becoming a test of Senate Democrats as well. The party's liberal base is pressing for a vigorous fight against Judge Roberts as documents from the Reagan administration clarify his conservative credentials. But some Democrats are reluctant to join in on the criticism of his record. A8 Tribute for Hunter S. Thompson Hunter S. Thompson's cremated remains were blasted into the sky over his farm in Colorado, boosted by red, blue and silver fireworks around a 153-foot monument that Mr. Thompson, the writer and avatar of ''gonzo'' journalism, designed himself almost 30 years ago.

The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide. [Page A1.] After one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system had shut down, slowing down imports and exports. One result could be that American consumers will be paying more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires. [C1.] From as far away as Massachusetts and Ohio, convoys of utility trucks and reinforcement workers are descending on the storm-damaged region to restore electricity to the estimated 1.7 million household and business customers still without power. [C1.] Landline and wireless phone service across the Gulf Coast from New Orleans eastward has been largely cut off, and work to restore it is going to take weeks, if not months.

The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. Interpublic has been plagued by financial and operational problems since 2002. Stuart Elliott: Advertising.

Such revenues seem excessive for a small firm like Bayou, hedge fund experts said. [C1.] Stocks Climb After Fed Official Comments on Rates Stocks climbed yesterday, rising after the president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve signaled that the central bank could change its interest rate policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Falling oil prices also helped stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.78 points, to 10,481.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.92 points, to 1,220.33, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.33 points, to 2,152.09.

Approves Drug for Children's Growth The Food and Drug Administration gave approval to the first new drug in 30 years for the treatment of abnormally short stature in children. It is the first drug approved for Tercica, a biotechnology company based in Brisbane, Calif. An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities. [C5.] As health officials worked to avoid another flu vaccine shortage like that in the 2004-5 season, regulators approved a flu shot from GlaxoSmithKline, and a Chiron vaccine plant in Liverpool that was shut last year because of contamination moved closer to being opened.

A3 Iran Rejects Europe's Demand Iran rejected a call by Europe to halt its nuclear program in two weeks or face possible Security Council penalties, and said it would not give in to what it called bullying. A3 Egypt to Ignore Poll Monitors The counry's electoral commission said that it would not abide by a court ruling authorizing non-government organizations to monitor the coming election for president, a decision that effectively placed the commission above the law and called into question the integrity of the vote scheduled to take place on Wednesday. A4 Egyptian investigators say they have concluded that three recent attacks in the Sinai Peninsula were linked. The assaults included the bombings at Taba in October and Sharm el Sheik in July and a smaller attack in August on peacekeepers in the Sinai. A4 Schr\u00f6der Debates Candidate Germany's conservative leader, Angela Merkel, accused Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of saddling the country with record high unemployment and a faltering economy, as the two met in a televised debate two weeks before an election that most polls predict will make Mrs. Merkel the first female chancellor in German history. A6 Fox Counters U.S. Criticism President Vicente Fox responded to criticism from American authorities about a recent surge in violence and illegal immigration along the border, saying that the United States shares responsibility for the problems and should work harder with Mexico to fix them.

A6 Hussein Trial to Start Oct. 19 The trial of Saddam Hussein will begin in six weeks, the Iraqi government said, when he and seven aides face a special tribunal on charges of massacring almost 150 residents from the town of Dujail, the scene of a failed assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein 23 years ago.

A6 NATIONAL A7-19 New Orleans SearchersAttention to the Dead Troops patrolled the streets, rescuers hunted for stragglers and New Orleans looked like a wrecked ghost town as the evacuation of the city neared completion and officials turned to the task of collecting bodies in a ghastly landscape awash in possibly thousands of corpses. A1 As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems with the initial response. A1 Strained by an influx of refugees , Texas struggled to house about a quarter-million victims of Hurricane Katrina in shelters and hotel rooms and began organizing an emergency airlift to divert thousands more to other states. A13 The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina became a rallying cry for African-American religious and political leaders in Houston, President Bush's former hometown, with pleas for charity mixed with a seething anger at the response to the crisis. A10 Perhaps not since Richard M. Nixon faced Vietnam-era tumult abroad and at home has an American president had to meet quite the combination of foreign war, domestic tribulations and political division that President Bush now confronts, from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf Coast to Capitol Hill. A1 New Orleans police officers shot and killed four people and wounded two others who had fired at officers escorting a convoy of contractors across a bridge, the authorities said. A13 Rehnquist Death Stirs Battle The death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist opened a second front in the ideological battle over the Supreme Court, with President Bush saying he would act quickly to replace him. A senior Republican aide said the schedule for the Roberts confirmation hearings, which had been set to begin Tuesday, was expected to be revised. A1 Advocacy groups on the left and the right scrambled to adjust to what had suddenly become a far more complicated struggle over judicial nominations with the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist. A19 William H. Rehnquist, who died at the age of 80, almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer, helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States. A17 Supreme Court justices say they were as surprised as the rest of the country to learn that the chief justice had died. A19 Labor Leaders See Opportunity As they have on past Labor Days, the nation's union leaders are vowing to reverse labor's decline, but that goal is made more difficult this year by the schism in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. A7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Candidates CriticizeResponse to Hurricane Outrage over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina has worked its way into New York City's mayoral campaign, with the leading Democratic candidates using the crisis as a vehicle for broader assertions that Republicans have neglected the poor. While the candidates were careful not to attack Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's response to the crisis, all four directed sharp rebukes at the Bush administration. B1 New Strategy in Yonkers Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers has recently held several town hall-style forums, urging residents to voice their opinions and ask questions of city officials. The meetings might be rather unremarkable in other places, but in a city where a history of nepotism fuels a sense of frustration and cynicism, the openness is a major shift in strategy and is giving some residents a reason for cautious optimism.

C1 Housing Market Altered As refugees from New Orleans poured into Baton Rouge, along with workers who expect to help with the rebuilding effort along the Gulf Coast, the local housing market has suddenly experienced the kind of frenzy that has been associated with New York, Miami or Silicon Valley in the past few years.

Scrutiny of Medical Devices Two federal lawmakers, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa and Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts, left, said they planned to increase their scrutiny of how the Food and Drug Administration monitors the safety of critical medical devices like heart defibrillators and pacemakers once they are on the market. In separate statements, they criticized what they described as the F.D.A.'s failure to alert the public to data about product problems. [C13.] An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of the Celgene drug Revlimid as a treatment for a potentially fatal blood disorder.

[C13.] Asbestos Trust Bars Payments in a Block of Claims The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, one of the oldest and largest trusts set up to compensate victims of asbestos exposure, has barred payments to claimants who rely on reports by nine doctors and three X-ray screening companies. The named doctors are responsible for tens of thousands of claims submitted to the trust. The move is a response to growing concern that some of the claims the trust receives are not valid and may even be fraudulent.

[C8.] The Oil Industry's Storm Watch Around the world, offshore oil and gas platforms are generally built to survive a so-called 100-year storm without serious damage. Then Hurricane Katrina struck. ''We're seeing more 100-year events happening more often, even every few years,'' one designer of offshore platforms said. ''The bar has to be higher.'' [C1.] Lawyers Begin Arguments in 2nd Vioxx Trial Lawyers in an Atlantic City court presented opening arguments in the second personal injury suit against Merck over its painkiller Vioxx to reach a jury. The case comes to trial almost one month after a Texas jury ordered Merck to pay $253 million to the widow of a man who died after taking Vioxx for eight months.

A15 New Orleans, One Month Later Abandoned city buses on deserted streets, doors opened for the boarding of ghosts. Fast-food restaurants, darkened and reeking of rancid meat. Tainted tap water, unsafe for contact with skin. Entire neighborhoods of empty, moldy houses, waiting for that bulldozer's first punch. This is the scene in New Orleans a month after the deluge. A19 Animals Take Over Highway There are no people along highway 27 between Cameron, La., and Lake Charles after 6 p.m. In their stead are animals, whose dusk-time proclivity for sauntering brazenly into the two-lane road has contributed to the strict curfew that comes a few hours earlier than those observed an hour to the west.

Jobs, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was back last week to introduce an iPod that can play video. Behind the News -- The bells and whistles of an Apple product unveiling are never to be ignored, but this time it was wedding bells: iPod and television are the happy couple. The new device can shop online for episodes from some ABC and Disney Channel shows, including from the night before, for about $2 a pop. The move comes after two years of Mr. Jobs's saying that nobody would watch a movie on a two-inch screen. TO BOSTON WE GO The News -- JetBlue said Tuesday that next month it would introduce 10 daily flights between New York and Boston. Behind the News -- It's the kind of airfare that could almost make a Yankee fan want to go into enemy territory: $25 one way, for tickets bought by this Thursday. Thereafter the flight will cost $40 to $120. But the route has long been dominated by the traditional major carriers, and they were not without an answer for JetBlue's latest nudging onto their turf. The next day American Airlines began offering $25 tickets on the same route, and Delta introduced a $40 fare. Take that, rookie. THE FOOT-WIDE JOURNAL The News -- The Wall Street Journal plans to shrink by about the width of the 'Street' in its banner. Behind the News -- The measure comes on the heels of The Journal's plan to shrink its international edition to tabloid size, starting next month. Both moves are in part a response to the increase in the cost of newsprint, an industrywide concern that has led other papers to similar decisions. Making The Journal smaller is expected to save its owner, Dow Jones, about $18 million a year. The company has said that it expected the smaller size to be more appealing to readers. ANOTHER GOOD THING? The News -- Martha Stewart is taking on a new partner, the housing developer KB Homes. The deal calls for a subdivision in Cary, N.C., to incorporate the style of Ms. Stewart's own homes into its 650 houses. Behind the News -- Before anyone who wants to live like Martha packs up the free-range chickens and heads to Cary, there are one or two questions to consider: one, is the housing industry heading into a downturn, and two, is Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose stock has fallen since March, diluting its brand as it branches into areas like satellite radio and music producing? YOU'VE GOT AOL! The News -- AOL.com has positioned itself as a free Web portal in recent months, with much of the content that used to be available only to subscribers now open to everyone. Last week, Time Warner, AOL's parent, officially unveiled the advertising campaign for it (at a cost estimated at $50 million). Behind the News -- The paying user continues to flee AOL, but Web sites that are part of it -- Moviefone, Mapquest, Netscape -- are a draw. That appeal may be behind talks between Time Warner and others regarding potential investments in AOL.

At the time, Toll Brothers was infamous for what Toll refers to as ''the estate home'' but what critics have, much to his dismay, tagged ''the McMansion.'' Toll's company, which he started with his younger brother, Bruce, in 1967 and took public in 1986, had spent the better part of the 1980's and early 1990's building thousands of these houses, princely abodes configured in a market-tested pattern of meandering streets and cul-de-sacs with names (the Glen at Hurley Ridge) meant to evoke afternoon teas and fox hunts. Once the boom was under way, however, Toll Brothers began to try new things. It broadened its product line by building more condominium units and retirement communities. More significant, it scouted property far from its traditional base in the Northeast. By the late 1990's, Toll Brothers possessed land in 18 states. The company purchased expensive urban sites in Jersey City and Manhattan; it even bought the hulking Maxwell House factory on the Hoboken waterfront, across the Hudson River from Midtown Manhattan, in partnership with another firm, in order to demolish the industrial shell and transform the site into a gigantic condominium complex. According to Bob Toll, he came to see his company as one that could build any kind of luxury home, in any style, in any place where there was opportunity.

His statement came as his company reported a $284 million loss in the third quarter, its first quarterly loss since the final three months of 2003. The company said it lost $1.49 billion, before taxes, in its North American automotive operations. [Page C1.] The United Auto Workers announced the details of its tentative agreement with General Motors and said that for the first time, G.M.'s union retirees will have to pay deductibles, monthly premiums and co-payments. [C3.] Google Tops Expectations with Third-Quarter Profit Finding more ways to make money from its spot as the world's most popular Internet search engine, Google topped Wall Street expectations and its own forecast and posted sharply higher profit in the third quarter. [C1.] Congress Passes Lawsuit Shield Law for Gun Industry Congress delivered a long-sought victory to the gun industry when the House voted to shield firearms manufacturers and dealers from liability lawsuits. The bill now goes to President Bush, who has promised to sign it. [A1.] Medical Publication Questions a Diabetes Drug An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the proposed diabetes pill Pargluva seems to significantly increase risks of heart attacks and strokes, and an accompanying editorial said the drug's sponsors, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, had submitted misleading data to the Food and Drug Administration that ''may have fostered an illusion of safety.'' [C7.] Roche has agreed to meet with four generic drug companies to discuss allowing them to manufacture the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu, which is in short supply as countries stockpile it to prepare for a possible flu pandemic. [C7.] Facing increasing generic competition and concerns about the heart risks of Celebrex, its once-popular painkiller, Pfizer said its third-quarter profit fell 50 percent, to $1.6 billion, and its sales fell 5 percent from the year earlier period. Profit for the current quarter will fall far short of analysts' forecasts, the company said and its shares fell 8 percent. [C7.] Advertising Executive Resigns Over Remarks Neil French, a well-known advertising executive and worldwide creative consultant at WPP Group, the world's second-largest agency holding company, resigned his position amid an uproar over remarks he made at an industry event about female creative executives. [C1.] SBC's Profit Falls on Costs of Hurricane and a Merger SBC Communications said its profit slipped 41 percent in the third quarter partly because its wireless unit, Cingular, had higher costs related to hurricanes and its merger with AT&T Wireless. [C3.] Senate Panel Approves Digital Television Measure A Senate panel approved legislation to complete the slow migration from analog to digital television by 2009, a transition of enormous importance to the television, cable and wireless telephone industries. [C3.] Nigeria Reaches Deal to Pay Debts at a Discount Nigeria reached an agreement with the Paris Club of creditors to pay off $30 billion of debt for $12 billion, a significant breakthrough for a nation long deemed too wealthy with oil money and too corrupt to be granted relief from debt accumulated over years of misrule. [A14.] Chinese Economy Grew 9.4 Percent in Third Quarter China's roaring economy grew 9.4 percent in the third quarter of this year, fueled by surging exports, strong investments in infrastructure and solid retail sales, according to a government report. [C4.] China's rapid economic growth has fostered a tourist boom among the mainland Chinese, with Southeast Asia the favorite destination, at least for now. And, like travelers for centuries before them, they are developing a reputation, which some say is loud and obnoxious. [C1.] After a quarter-century of growth powered largely by exports, China is showing signs of opening a new chapter of strong growth, this time propelled by domestic spending. [C4.] Europe Fails Again to Reach Deal for Lower Farm Tariffs The European Union failed again to deliver new cuts in its farm tariffs and subsidies, held back by France's refusal to allow deeper reductions, while other trading nations laid pressure on Europe to act. Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, left, who has become a spokesman for developing nations in these talks, urged Europe to break the logjam. [C13.] Stocks Fall Sharply on Report of High Inflation Stocks sold off sharply, pushing the three major gauges down more than 1 percent, after a major inflation gauge hit a 25-year high and stirred fears of higher interest rates, while Pfizer posted disappointing quarterly results.

The Washington trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 9. (AP) Profits Decline at Archer Daniels Midland Shares of the Archer Daniels Midland Company rose yesterday despite a 30 percent decline in first-quarter earnings from sluggish grain sales because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Much of the profit decline was attributed to the agricultural services unit, which was disrupted by the storms. The largest business segments, including corn and oilseed processing, showed solid profit growth. Net income was $186.3 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $266.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 33 cents a share. Sales dropped 4 percent, to $8.63 billion, below analysts' estimates of $9.08 billion.

The Federal Communications Commission met through the day but could not agree on what conditions, if any, should be attached to the deals. Another meeting was set for Monday. The negotiations come a day after the Justice Department gave its blessing to the acquisitions, with limited conditions.

Kiyosaki's financial literacy manifesto, ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad'' is No. 4 on this week's paperback advice list. First published in 1997, this thing has now been on the list for 260 weeks -- longer than all but a handful of titles, including ''The Road Less Traveled'' (694 weeks) and ''The Joy of Sex (363 weeks). Kiyosaki, who was born in Hawaii, has diversified feverishly in the years since ''Rich Dad'' was released -- there are now 10 books in the ''Rich Dad'' series, he's done infomercials, been on ''Oprah'' and played Madison Square Garden. Kiyosaki's book is often credited with helping start the boom in ''flipping'' real estate, but as Carol Lloyd pointed out recently in The San Francisco Chronicle, he's backing off some of that advice now. ''I'm worried about people using their houses as A.T.M. machines,'' he said. He added that flipping is ''really stupid right now.'' (These days, he is more bullish on oil and gold.) Kiyosaki's kind of success can bring scrutiny. When I punched his name into Google, for example, the top hit was a strenuous, almost book-length put-down of ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad'' by the newsletter publisher John T. Reed. (Reed doesn't call Kiyosaki ''the worst financial guru of my generation,'' but he comes close.) Still, as Kiyosaki said on CNN earlier this year: ''The world is full of critics, and I ask those critics, 'Have you sold 20 million copies of a book so far? Are you a multimillionaire?' '' BACK PAGES: Fifty years ago this week, in the Oct. 16, 1955, issue of the Book Review, Herman Wouk had the No. 1 place on the fiction list with ''Marjorie Morningstar.'' Wouk's novel had been the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it was reviewed on the Book Review's cover. (The critic Maxwell Geismar wrote about it here, and frostily. He called it ''very good reading indeed,'' but added: ''The values of true culture are as remote from its polished orbit as are, at base, the impulses of real life.'') Rounding out the top five positions on the fiction list were Patrick Dennis's ''Auntie Mame,'' Sloan Wilson's ''Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' Robert Ruark's ''Something of Value'' and Francoise Sagan's ''Bonjour Tristesse.'' Sagan's novel was reviewed in these pages by the French writer Marcel Arland, who likened it to ''a cocktail -- as smooth and stimulating, and as complicated as you could wish from a young girl.'' (The ingredients of Sagan's fizzy mix, Arland wrote, were ''a piquant situation . . . a little perversity, a dash of false candor'' and ''a tinge of involuntary frankness.'') On the nonfiction list, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's ''Gift From the Sea'' was at No. 1, followed by Norman Vincent Peale's ''Power of Positive Thinking,'' John A. Schindler's ''How to Live 365 Days a Year,'' Edward Steichen's ''Family of Man'' and Catherine Marshall's ''Man Called Peter.''

The company says it has 1.1 million subscribers. Here are excerpts from an interview: Q. How big is the market in the United States for online dating? A. The market is very big and it's growing rapidly. We've done the single most extensive study of the singles market and we found there are some 90 million single people over the age of 18. Of that 90 million, approximately 33 million are currently looking for an enduring relationship. Q. The field is dominated by three players: your company, Yahoo Personals and eHarmony. What is your competitive strength? A. Most of the people on our site are willing to post multiple photographs of themselves when they're filling out their profile. They've got complete essays that describe their backgrounds and their interests. So if you're interested in meeting somebody, it's much easier to find that person when you're interacting with all those profiles. Q. Do you specialize in a certain demographic or age group? A. A lot of people presume that online dating at Match.com is for the youth segment, meaning 18- to 25-year-olds. But it turns out, in the age range of 18 to 25, they've already got lots of possibilities to meet people. Their social system allows them to interact with all sorts of single people. Our average customer is in their mid-30's. Many people have already been through a serious relationship or a marriage that didn't work out. When you've been with one person for a longer period of time, your social circle pivots around that person. When you find yourself single again, you need to expand your possibilities. Q. What's the gender breakout of your clientele? A. We've got slightly more men than women. It's about 55 percent to 45 percent. Q. How do you segment your market? A. We have identified three segments. It doesn't really break down by male or female, or even by age. It breaks down by behaviors. One is the ''broaden my options'' segment, which is the core Match segment. They were the early adopters. The next segment we call the ''find my match'' segment and then there's the ''give me help'' segment. They're roughly equal in size. The difference is in how comfortable they are online and how much advice and guidance they want. Q. What does it say about American culture that so many people are going online to meet? A. If you think about how anyone meets anyone these days, the Internet is so much a part of our social ecosystem that it's perfectly normal, based on where people spend their time, that this might be an environment where people actually meet each other. It says a lot about where we are as a society and our adoption of technology, and how mainstream and normal the Internet feels. Q. What are you trying to do globally? A. We think markets in Europe and Asia Pacific are about 18 to 24 months behind where the United States is in online dating. But I think three to five years from now, 50 percent of our business will be overseas. We've got the No. 1 market share position in Europe and we've got some early ventures in Japan. We're looking actively at China. We've got an operation in Australia. Q. How are you overcoming the cultural differences in, say, Japan? A. The idea of relationships and people falling in love is similar globally. But the process by which they do it is different. In Japan, where we've just launched our mobile, or cellphone, service, it's much more of a youth market that's experimenting with the service. It's not unlike the U.S., where initially there was a vicarious curiosity. That curiosity turns into serious intent because people find it really is an effective way to meet people who might be outside your existing social circle. Q. What about France? A. When it comes to a product about love, the French don't want to take any advice from anyone but the French. So even though we have a global platform, we have local management teams in each country that customize the software so that it looks and feels like it's being produced in that country. When you're doing a search within any given country or any given city, the people you're seeing are all local people. Localization is absolutely key. If it smells like an American product built for connecting French people for love, they'll reject it immediately. Q. How did Match.com survive the bursting of the dot-com bubble? A. I wasn't there for the bursting of the bubble and the reigniting of the Internet thereafter. But one of the things about Match, like the other companies that survived, is that it's a real business that wasn't built on metrics like ''unique users'' and ''page views.'' We are a subscription-based business, so there were real paying subscribers. There was a community of people and it had a network effect. The more people signed up and found value, it generated more subscribers. It's been profitable but revenues were flat. The challenge for me was to reignite growth. In this year's second quarter, we grew our revenue by 26 percent.", "headline": {"main": "For Some Searches, Google Won't Do", "kicker": "OFFICE SPACE: ARMCHAIR M.B.A."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 910, "_id": "4fd2510d8eb7c8105d7f51a2", "snippet": "A growing acceptance of going online to find you a find, catch you a catch.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/business/yourmoney/06advi.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/11/05/business/06advi.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/11/05/business/06advi.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MATCH.COM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "IAC/INTERACTIVECORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATING (SOCIAL)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "HOLSTEIN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By WILLIAM J.

The new service builds on the company's TiVo to Go feature, which allows some subscribers to transfer shows to a laptop or personal computer. Behind the News -- The television networks have yet another reason to hate TiVo, which first encroached on their turf by offering viewers the ability to watch television shows when they wanted, without the commercials. Now, TiVo could hurt the networks' attempts to develop another revenue stream by selling shows by the episode. For instance, ABC plans to sell downloads of ''Desperate Housewives'' on Apple iPods for 99 cents. But why pay, when you can download from TiVo for free? X-GAMES BEGIN The News -- Microsoft released its Xbox 360, its next-generation game machine, at midnight on Tuesday. Buyers lined up for hours to be among the first to purchase it. Behind the News -- Industry analysts said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long run. The real question is whether the 360 can outsell Sony's next-generation game console, PlayStation 3, which is not due out until spring. LIBRARY DOWNLOAD The News -- Google gave $3 million to help the Library of Congress build a World Digital Library on the Web. For the project, the National Library of Egypt has already agreed to digitize documents of Islamic science from the 10th century. Behind the News -- Google's gift may be good public relations. The Library of Congress emphasized that Google's gift comes with no strings attached and no copyright problems. That would be welcome news for Google, which has faced copyright issues because of its Book Search project, a book- scanning effort in partnership with five research libraries. GOODNIGHT, TED The News -- On Tuesday, Ted Koppel, the anchor of ''Nightline'' ended his 25-year reign as late night's Mr. Serious. Behind the News -- Will ''Nightline'' survive? Under Mr. Koppel, it has struggled in the ratings, generally falling behind NBC's ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' and CBS's ''Late Show With David Letterman.''

A1 In private conversations, American officials are beginning to acknowledge that a judgment about when withdrawals from Iraq can begin is driven by two political calendars -- one in Iraq and one in the United States -- as much as by military assessments. The final decision could hinge on whether the new Iraqi government, scheduled to be elected in less than three weeks, issues its own call for an American pullout. A1 Graft Endangers Caspian Fish Although international and domestic regulations protect the sturgeon on paper, manifest lawlessness and graft in the Caspian region have led to unchecked fishing and struggling hatcheries. A1 Chinese Legal System Tested A 2003 ruling that struck down a local law on seed prices has become, quite unexpectedly, a landmark case for the evolving Chinese legal system, and exposed the limits on judicial autonomy in China and the political retribution faced by judges. A1 Iran Hit by Powerful Quake A powerful earthquake hit southern Iran, causing major destruction in seven villages, killing 10 people and injuring 80. The tremor shook Oman and the United Arab Emirates as well, forcing many office workers to evacuate their buildings. A6 Banned Egyptian Party Gains The banned Muslim Brotherhood has demonstrated in the latest Parliamentary elections that it is by far the strongest Egyptian opposition group, trouncing the secular political opposition and weakening the governing party's power monopoly. A3 Zimbabwe Party Shows Power Zimbabwe's ruling party predictably appeared assured of an overwhelming victory as officials tallied the results of a record low turnout in this weekend's election for the newly created upper house of Parliament. A9 Muslim Leaders Skip Meeting The European Union opened a two-day conference in Barcelona aimed at renewing its commitment to developing and democratizing Muslim nations on the Mediterranean's southern rim -- a summit meeting marked by the absence of many of the North African and Middle Eastern leaders who had originally agreed to attend. A9 Crime Central to Honduras Vote A continuing problem of violent crime, most of it attributed to youth gangs, was at the center of presidential elections in Honduras as two wealthy conservative businessmen remained locked in a tight contest to govern one of the poorest nations in Latin America. A9 NATIONAL A13-17 Texas Janitors' Drive Gives Unions Hope Service Employees International Union organizers have obtained what they say is majority support in one of the biggest unionization drives in the South in decades, collecting the signatures of thousands of Houston janitors. A1 Cheerleaders and Sales Many pharmaceutical companies are recruiting cheerleaders as sales representatives. Some industry critics view wholesomely sexy drug representatives as a variation on the more tangible gifts that pharmaceutical companies previously dangled to sway doctors to their brands. A1 Group Rallies for Prisoner A group called Trial and Error, which claims a membership in the thousands, is trying to free a man convicted 16 years ago of what many consider to be Maine's most notorious crime. Many law enforcement officials, however, remain convinced that he is the killer. A13 Catholics Split on Gay Priests Grappling with the implications of a Vatican directive issued last week that would bar most gay men from seminaries, Roman Catholics at parishes around the country offered contrasting interpretations of its impact on the priesthood, on the potential for future sexual abuse by clergy members and on the church itself. A13 Golf and Archaeology Clash The Newark Earthworks, a sprawling and complex series of earthen mounds sculpted by the Hopewell Indians 2,000 years ago, is now home of the Moundbuilders Country Club. But the club's plans to double the size of its clubhouse prompted an organized protest. A15 New Tax Law Pinches Charities The New Hope Day Center in Lansing, Mich., serves about 100 homeless people a day, providing meals and services like job training and substance abuse counseling. But the shelter could close next year -- a casualty, the operators say, of changes in federal tax laws. A14 Speaker Disputes Kerry Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, is taking issue with statements sent out by Senator John Kerry, saying the senator falsely accused him of labeling Representative John P. Murtha a coward. An adviser to Mr. Kerry said the senator was comfortable with his characterization of the speaker's reaction. A17 Time Reporter Asked to Testify A second reporter for Time magazine, Viveca Novak, has been asked to testify under oath in the C.I.A. leak case, about conversations in 2004 with a lawyer for Karl Rove, the magazine reported. The request for Ms. Novak's testimony is a sign that Mr. Fitzgerald has not yet completed his inquiry into Mr. Rove's actions. A17 Merck to Detail Restructuring Merck, under pressure from investors and analysts to cut costs and pare thousands of employees from its payroll, said it would soon announce details of its long-awaited restructuring plan. A16 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Man Pushed to Death In Path of Subway Train Edison Guzman, a bakery worker from Queens, was killed when a man his family described as a friend and former co-worker threw him into the path of an oncoming subway train during a fight, the police said. Charges against the friend, Richie Molina of Brooklyn, were pending. B1 Community Resists Change Gowanus, an industrial neighborhood squeezed amid brownstone Brooklyn, has attracted proposals to convert its factory spaces into residential ones. But many residents want to preserve the urban way of life in Gowanus, where workers lived among their workplaces. B1 Arrest Prompts Inquiries Investigators in three states have been examining whether John F. Regan, a man from a prominent Connecticut family recently charged with stalking women, has links to several unsolved sex crimes and murders reaching back nearly two decades. B1 Neediest Cases B6 SPORTSMONDAY D1-9 ARTS E1-10 Art Institutions in the Home Two neighbors in Harlem have opened new cultural institutions in their own homes. George Preston turned three floors of his brownstone into the Museum of Art and Origins.

Titled ''The Public Sings,'' theevent will feature artists performing selections from signature Public Theater musicals. E7 OBITUARIES B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 Discount Chains Thrive As the nation's retail executives began poring over, and in some cases, despairing over sales receipts from the holiday weekend, one pattern became clearer: consumers mobbed discount chains, but largely shopped right past other specialty retailers at the mall. C1 Assessing Spielberg's Value As NBC Universal closes in on a likely deal to acquire the live-action film business of its longtime partner DreamWorks SKG, one of the transaction's more intriguing questions remains: What will the media conglomerate really get if it picks up one of DreamWorks's most significant assets, the services of the co-founder Steven Spielberg? C1 Success for Hunan TV Hunan TV, one of the most powerful television properties in China, has found success by creating zany, off-beat and even risqu\u00e9 entertainment programs in a country still dominated by bland and predictable state-run programming.

Q. What's it like for Palm watching this long-running legal drama involving R.I.M.? A. The one thing that we can continue to be focused on is competing in the marketplace, and certainly this may bring some uncertainty to R.I.M.'s customers and they may be more interested in looking at some of our solutions. But I don't think -- my sense is that ultimately it will be resolved between the parties and I think the idea that the BlackBerry service will be discontinued is extremely unlikely. Q. There is a perception out there that a recent court ruling, which refused to impose a settlement between R.I.M. and the patent holding company, NTP, is good news for you. Your stock went up on the news and a lot of people see this as an opportunity for Palm to grab even more market share of corporate customers. A. If that's the perception among enterprise customers, then that's the one that matters.

A1 American and Iraqi forces raiding an Iraqi government detention center in Baghdad discovered more than 600 prisoners packed into a cramped space, 13 of them mistreated so badly they had to be taken to a hospital, a senior American official said. A1 Chinese Officer Held in Deaths The commander of paramilitary forces who opened fire on villagers protesting land seizures was detained by the authorities in connection with the shootings, an extraordinary response that suggested high-level concern over whether the crackdown was justified. A1 Paris Suburb Symbolizes Riots La Courneuve, a Paris suburb of 35,000 people of 80 nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, has become a symbol of France's failure to integrate millions of Arab and African immigrants -- many of them Muslims -- and their French-born children and grandchildren. A1 Top Croat Suspect at the Hague For the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, taking custody of Ante Gotovina means the end of a four-year wait and the capture of one of its most-wanted suspects from the Balkan wars of the 1990's. A3 Rights Unit Faults Sudan Leader The United Nations should impose sanctions on top political and military leaders in Sudan and conduct an investigation of crimes against humanity committed in Darfur, Human Rights Watch said in a report that accuses senior officials, including President Omar al-Bashir, of playing major roles in making civilians the target of attacks. A5 Quebec Party Courts Minorities The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party has put up a record nine candidates of Haitian, African, Middle Eastern and Chinese origin this year to appeal to minorities and win toss-up districts in the Jan. 23 election, with the larger goal of winning a third separatist referendum expected in the next few years. A6 Runoff in Chile Election With ballots counted in the first round of voting in Chile's presidential election, a candidate who describes her rise as unlikely because she is ''a woman, a Socialist, separated and agnostic'' and a conservative billionaire businessman have advanced to a decisive runoff. A6 Finns Build Largest Reactor With continued spikes in gas and fuel prices, fears about overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming, Finland has decided to move ahead this year with the construction of the world's largest nuclear reactor, and a number of countries, including the United States, are freshening up proposals to build nuclear plants. A10 NATIONAL A16-23 A Clash Over Rebuilding Gulf Coast After Hurricane There is a broad clash along the Gulf Coast over whether to rebuild hurricane-damaged areas much as they were, to rebuild at a higher price, with more robust foundations and buildings raised above ground, or to cede large swaths of land to nature. The debate features a cast that includes disaster victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, as well as local, state and federal officials. A1 Tackling Medicaid Costs Members of Congress will soon plunge into battle over the future of Medicaid, as House and Senate negotiators try to resolve huge differences over legislation that would allow states to cut benefits and increase charges for millions of low-income people, including many children. Medicaid is a flash point in a larger budget bill on which Republican leaders say they plan to reach agreement by year's end. A21 Disputes Over Abuse Ban The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, predicted that Congress and the Bush administration would reach agreement this week over a proposal to ban torture of terrorism detainees, but those engaged in the negotiations said major differences remained. A19 Reporter Talks About Leak Viveca Novak, a reporter for Time magazine, said a lawyer for Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser, was surprised when she suggested to him in the first half of 2004 that Mr. Rove had probably been a source for the magazine's July 2003 article that discussed the C.I.A. officer at the heart of the leak case. A23 Virginia Governor Ponders Bid Propelled by his popularity at home, Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia has launched a major foray onto the national stage, raising millions of dollars for his likely presidential bid and visiting states already being courted by potential 2008 contenders. The latest stop came in Florida this weekend at a state Democratic Party convention. A16 Still No Decision on Inmate As fervor over the scheduled execution of Stanley Tookie Williams early Tuesday began to boil across California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined for a third day to announce a decision on a petition to spare the life of Mr. Williams, a former gangster and now-famous death row inmate, and commute his sentence to life in prison. A16 Administration Word of Choice Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Al Qaeda's ultimate goal is the re-establishment of the caliphate, with calamitous consequences for the United States. Caliphate is the term for the seventh-century Islamic empire that spanned the Middle East, spread to Southwest Asia, North Africa and Spain, then ended with the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. A19 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Two Men Are Charged With Officer's Murder The two men arrested in the fatal shooting of a police officer in the Bronx were charged with murder as new details emerged that led investigators to believe that the men were trying to steal Valium from a dead man's apartment when the officer, Daniel Enchautegui, confronted them. The suspects, who were shot by Officer Enchautegui before he died, remained in stable condition, the police said. B1 G.O.P. Looks for a Way Out New York State Republican leaders were supposed to vote on their preferred candidates for 2006 at a meeting today in Albany. But the vote is now in doubt: some Republicans want only to plot strategy and emerge with a party intact. B1 Two Killed in Queens A man and a woman were killed and two other people injured when a gunman opened fire in the vestibule of a building at a public housing project in the Rockaways, the police said. B3 Neediest Cases B4 ARTS E1-10 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Dressing the Men of the N.B.A. When the N.B.A. instituted a business-casual dress code this season to spruce up the league's image, plenty of grumbling ensued among players, commentators and fans alike. But the new dress code has boosted an already thriving specialty trade: The haberdashers and purveyors of fine dress shoes who cater to outsize professional athletes.
