So often, since 9/11, people have remarked to me: ''Wow, Islam, that's a really angry religion.'' I disagree. I do agree, though, that there are a lot of young Muslims who are angry, because they live in some of the most repressive societies, with the fewest opportunities for women and youth, and with some of the highest unemployment. Bad contexts create an environment where humiliation -- and the anger, bad ideas and violence that flow from it -- are rife. In short, it is impossible for us to talk about winning the war of ideas in the Arab-Muslim world without talking about the most basic thing that gives people dignity and hope: A job. ''For a long time now, I've felt that what we're really facing is not a clash of civilizations, but a clash of generations,'' argued David Rothkopf, a former acting U.S. under secretary of commerce.

The memos featured Diebold employees' candid discussion of flaws in the company's software and warnings that the computer network was poorly protected from hackers. In light of the chaotic 2000 presidential election, the Swarthmore students decided that this information shouldn't be kept from the public. Like aspiring Daniel Ellsbergs with their would-be Pentagon Papers, they posted the files on the Internet, declaring the act a form of electronic whistle-blowing. Unfortunately for the students, their actions ran afoul of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (D.M.C.A.), one of several recent laws that regulate intellectual property and are quietly reshaping the culture. Designed to protect copyrighted material on the Web, the act makes it possible for an Internet service provider to be liable for the material posted by its users -- an extraordinary burden that providers of phone service, by contrast, do not share. Under the law, if an aggrieved party (Diebold, say) threatens to sue an Internet service provider over the content of a subscriber's Web site, the provider can avoid liability simply by removing the offending material.

It has sued to stop a pair of coffee shops in Shanghai from using the name xingbake. This is the age of globalization, after all. In Chinese, star = xing, and in a way Starbucks = Xingbake. ''We came first,'' Xingbake's general manager said. ''We can't lose.'' His name is Mao. .An Atlanta music writer known as bill wyman received a cease-and-desist letter from lawyers representing the former Rolling Stones bass player known as Bill Wyman: demanding, that is, that he ''cease and desist'' using his name. In responding, Bill Wyman No. 1 pointed out that Bill Wyman No. 2 had been born William George Perks. . The German car company known as Dr. Ing. h.c.F. Porsche AG has fought a series of battles to protect the name carrera. But another contender is a Swiss village, postal code 7122. ''The village Carrera existed prior to the Porsche trademark,'' Christoph Reuss of Switzerland wrote to Porsche's lawyers. ''Porsche's use of that name constitutes a misappropriation of the good will and reputation developed by the villagers of Carrera.'' He added, for good measure, ''The village emits much less noise and pollution than Porsche Carrera.'' He didn't mention that Jos\u00e9 Carreras, the opera singer, was embroiled in a name dispute of his own. The car company, meanwhile, also claims trademark ownership of the numerals 911. . A Canadian businessman known as Jeff Burgar, living in High Prairie, a small town in Alberta, owns lots of names in dot-com territory. He registered J.R.R. Tolkien's name as an Internet domain in 1996 and held on to jrrtolkien.com until this year, when a panel of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) took it away from him. The name Tolkien -- just the name, as distinct from the prose, stories, characters and ideas -- is big business. Others who claim to own pieces of it -- as a brand and a trademark, either registered or unregistered -- are heirs, publishers and moviemakers; never mind the several thousand individuals worldwide who happen to come by the surname honestly. Burgar, meanwhile, has taken some other names in vain: celine dion, albert einstein, michael crichton and about 1,500 more. In many of these cases, battles have ensued -- even the ghost of Albert Einstein fought back, via the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Burgar loses most of these cases, but not all. ''It's a kangaroo court,'' he said matter-of-factly. ''They seem to change the rules on the fly.'' Even so, he owns Bruce Springsteen's name, at least on the Internet. The world is running out of names. The roster of possible names seems almost infinite, but the demand is even greater.

As he departed, he told a reporter he wanted to sit down and relax with a glass of wine and a blank sheet of paper. This was perhaps not so true: it's hard to imagine Joy with a blank sheet of paper. Thoughts and ideas pile up furiously in his notebooks; diagrams and scribbles and equations issue forth at all hours of the day and night. When Joy, 49, finally moved out of a small Sun office in downtown Aspen, where he had worked since the late 1980's, he had to archive 900 pounds of professional papers. Then it took him months to go through his personal records, which filled 20 fireproof file cabinets. Over the past few months, Joy has been splitting his time between a new house in Marin County, Calif., and his main home in Aspen, where his two children go to school. ''I'm in an in-between thing,'' he says. Indeed, there are at least two Bill Joys. Start with Joy the computer scientist -- or computer architect, as he often describes himself -- a Silicon Valley deity, generally regarded as one of the most gifted engineers ever to have negotiated freeway traffic. Much of the present-day Internet is built upon the Unix code Joy wrote in the 1970's when he was a grad student at Berkeley; after that, his signature inventions shaped the Java programming language and the Sun computer servers that power a good portion of the Web. This Bill Joy recently flirted with the idea of taking a job at Google and continues to entertain pitches from friends and strangers eager to have him join their start-ups.

As much as I appreciated the painter's drawing skills and his triumphs of color, form and composition, my first thought was of the fresh sea flavor of the pearly meat within the fiery red shell, and how well it would be complemented by a sparkling mac\u00e9doine of those grapes, melon and peaches. I'm a firm believer in art for art's sake, and am rarely interested in the hidden meaning of its content, like apples signifying evil while pears are blessed (who knew?). But when the subject is food, as it is in so many still lifes, another aesthetic concern overtakes me. That is especially true when different foods are grouped together. Did the artist portray only what he found in the kitchen, or did he deliberately shop for the dish -- painting with both his art and his supper in mind? If so, did he paint rapidly lest his subject spoil before he could partake of it?

Bouvard and P\u00e9cuchet (the names Gustave Flaubert gave to his two comic heroes) discovered through their friendship a common purpose: the pursuit of universal knowledge. To achieve this ambitious goal, they attempted to read everything they could find on every branch of human endeavor and, from their readings, cull the most outstanding facts and ideas. Flaubert's death in 1880 put an end to their enterprise, which was in essence endless, but not before the two brave explorers had read their way through many learned volumes on agriculture, literature, animal husbandry, medicine, archeology and politics, always with disappointing results. What Flaubert's two clowns discovered is what we have always known but seldom believed: that the accumulation of knowledge isn't knowledge. The desire to know everything on earth and in heaven is so ancient that one of the earliest accounts of this ambition is already a cautionary tale.

In May, Ana Marie Cox, the Internet gossip whose Web log, Wonkette, focuses on Washington, published a link to another blogger who called herself the Washingtonienne. In the blog, Washingtonienne, a Capitol Hill employee, used a Senate computer to post intimate details about her experience sleeping with six different men, some of whom were paying for her favors. Washingtonienne listed her partners by their initials and occupations, from the married ''Chief of Staff at one of the gov agencies, appointed by Bush'' to her current boyfriend, a fellow Senate staff member. Praising Washingtonienne for her candor and honesty (''You go, girl!''), Wonkette identified her as Jessica Cutler, a 26-year-old mail sorter for Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, who promptly fired her from her $25,000-a-year job. After a flurry of interviews in the newspapers and on TV, she sold a novel based on her blog to Hyperion for a figure that Wonkette estimated at $300,000. Cutler's agent announced that she would pose nude for Playboy but would not talk to the media until the book was published. Her privacy, after all, had to be respected. The men whose initials Cutler posted were not so lucky. In an effort to identify the Bush appointee who was paying for sex, Wonkette posted pictures of 13 chiefs of staff at federal agencies under the headline, ''Would You Sell Sex to This Man?'' One of the suspects was a law-school classmate of mine, Frank Jimenez, who had recently served as chief of staff at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. When I saw the photo, I wondered if his career was over. Happily, the following day, Jimenez was completely exonerated by Wonkette: Cutler's ''F'' was married, while Jimenez was single. But during those hours of uncertainty, Jimenez experienced the peculiar anxiety of being falsely implicated in someone else's Internet exhibitionism. ''I went to the gym during lunch, and when I came back, there were e-mails and voice mails from concerned friends,'' he said. ''I was amazed at how many friends were following the story in real time, like a cyber soap opera.'' Jimenez, who said he was never so glad to be single in his life, added, ''I would hope that bloggers would be more circumspect about what they post on the Web: it's no different than old-fashioned gossip spread by word of mouth, but modern technology has magnified its impact a millionfold, and it's potentially more harmful because of its permanence.''", "headline": {"main": "Your Blog or Mine?", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-19-04: PHENOMENON"}, "abstract": "Jeffrey Rosen article on how bloggers are blurring lines between public events and ordinary social interactions; says as blogs continue to proliferate, citizens will have to develop new understandings about what is on and off the record; says favorite topics among personal bloggers, who are more likely to be women than men, are sex and dating; privacy issues, especially in light of revealing sexual liaisons, discussed; drawings (L)", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 3194, "_id": "4fd2414c8eb7c8105d7d98ff", "snippet": "Sex is the favorite topic for online journals \u0097 and the very private has never been more public.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/magazine/19PHENOM.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/12/16/magazine/19phen.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/12/16/magazine/19phen.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SEX"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATING (SOCIAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLOGS AND BLOGGING (INTERNET)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRIVACY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jeffrey", "lastname": "Rosen"}], "original": "By Jeffrey Rosen"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-12-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 5, "offset": 0, "time": 50}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

This is a logical step for Google, which says its mission ''is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'' The idea of making books available online is not new, but this plan represents an enormous shift in scale, so enormous that if it is carried out successfully, it may redefine the nature of the Internet and the university.
