So I decided to have chicken soup to ward off the cold. Nonetheless I got the cold. This happens all the time: you think you're getting a cold; you have chicken soup; you get the cold anyway. So: is it possible that chicken soup gives you a cold? I will confess a bias: I've never understood the religious fervor that surrounds breast-feeding. There are fanatics out there who believe you should breast-feed your child until he or she is old enough to unbutton your blouse. Their success in conning a huge number of women into believing this is one of the truly grim things about modern life. Anyway, one of the main reasons given for breast-feeding is that breast-fed children are less prone to allergies.

But potential ''big fix'' approaches to climate change -- constructing immense space mirrors to deflect solar radiation, say -- are often derided as science fiction that diverts talent and financing from more plausible solutions. John Holdren, for one, as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, noted its ''combination of high costs, low leverage and a high likelihood of serious side effects.'' So it was with considerable surprise in late 2006 that Paul Crutzen, one of the most prominent and respected atmospheric chemists in the world, proposed cooling the earth by pumping millions of tons of sulfur into the stratosphere. It would be the man-made equivalent of a volcanic eruption, spreading a thin layer of particles around the planet and increasing its reflectivity. Crutzen's proposal appeared in the scientific journal Climatic Change, but the mainstream media quickly picked it up and set off a fierce debate over the ethics and efficacy of such large-scale human interference with the atmosphere. Crutzen, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for his work on the the ozone layer, was feeling deeply frustrated. ''I saw how little action was taking place on reducing greenhouse emissions,'' he says. He published his article in desperation, hoping that ''maybe this is a way of reducing the heating rate in the atmosphere.'' Natural science backs Crutzen up. After the massive 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, the resulting haze of sulfuric acid in the stratosphere temporarily lowered global temperatures by nearly a full degree. Doing this ourselves is complicated, of course. The sulfur would have to be carried aloft by rockets or balloons -- and every year or two, at a cost of untold billions of dollars. For Crutzen, the article was intended to be provocative, to prod the discussion and encourage research. ''Although I want it to be debated, to test whether this solution is feasible, looking for side effects is very essential,'' he says. Such side effects could be profound, like a diminished ozone layer. ''It's not really a nice experiment to put a million tons of sulfur into the stratosphere,'' he says. ''It's a quite dirty experiment.''

On The Times's Op-Ed page recently, he called spyware ''a good idea'' and wrote of his own children (ages 6 to 14): ''I want to know what's being said in e-mail and instant messages and in chat rooms.'' Many parents, Coben is aware, prefer to take less drastic measures. On CBS's ''Early Show'' he explained: ''We're all a little bit guilty of being helicopter parents, hovering over our kids. We don't let them cross the street; we want to write their college essays for them; we berate their coaches about playing time. But when it comes to this box in the house, all the sudden they deserve total independence? This box that can show them beheadings and bestiality and let them chat with strangers?'' O.K.

There's one on Cooks.com that's a close adaptation of The Times's recipe, another by Mario Batali on the Food Network's Web site and one by Anna Teresa Callen, the cookbook author and teacher, on her own Web site.

The agency has announced that it will phase out its aging fleet of space shuttles by the year 2010, and the next iteration of the space program, known as Constellation, isn't likely to be sending people into orbit before 2015. Back in 2004, President Bush exhorted NASA to return humans to the moon (and then continue on to Mars), but precious little has been heard from the White House on the matter since. The American enthusiasm for space travel that accompanied the first footprints on the lunar surface seems less ardent with each year that separates us from that one small step. Yet human space flight hardly tells the whole story about launching pads and orbits. In addition to NASA's current robotic missions -- including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars landers and the Cassini spacecraft -- there is also a large market for sending satellites into space. Between 1998 and 2007, 421 satellites were sent skyward. Government programs, commercial launchings and consumer products tied to satellites make up a $251-billion-a-year industry, according to the Space Foundation, a group that tracks the global space economy. The technologies in orbit serve the needs of television and radio; Internet and telephone service; imaging systems for military and intelligence operations (as well as commercial services like Google Earth); and the global positioning systems that help guide planes, boats and automobiles from Point A to Point B. Last year, according to the consulting firm Futron, about 70 orbital satellites were launched into space: roughly 25 by the United States and 30 by Russia. Of the 41 commercial launchings in 2006, about half belonged to the United States. Periodically, the U.S. military continues to test unarmed missiles that are designed to carry warheads.", "headline": {"main": "Trajectories"}, "abstract": "NASA may be phasing out aging fleet of shuttles, but there remains large market for sending satellites into space; Space Foundation reports that government programs, commercial launchings and consumer products tied to satellites comprise $251-billion-a-year industry; photos (M)", "print_page": "62", "word_count": 441, "_id": "4fd295b68eb7c8105d870de6", "snippet": "The rise of rockets in the post-space-age age.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/magazine/11rockets-t.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2008/05/07/magazine/11rockets01_75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2008/05/07/magazine/11rockets01_75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPACE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPACE SHUTTLE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROCKETS AND ROCKET PROPULSION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SATELLITES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Text", "middlename": "John", "lastname": "SCHWARTZ", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "Text by JOHN SCHWARTZ"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-05-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "In the face of the expansion of the classified ads Web site Craigslist, its founder, Craig Newmark, is capitalizing on his success to promote causes he holds dear.", "headline": {"main": "Craig (of the List) Looks Beyond the Web", "sub": "A Pursuit of Growth, as Well, In Politics and Advocacy Projects  ;", "print_headline": "Craig (of the List) Looks Beyond the Web"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": "1519", "_id": "5481597a38f0d874625c84c4", "snippet": "In the face of the expansion of the classified ads Web site Craigslist, its founder, Craig Newmark, is capitalizing on his success to promote causes he holds dear.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/technology/12craig.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "wide", "url": "images/2008/05/12/business/0512-biz-subclrCRAIGSLIST-1.jpg", "height": 126, "width": 190, "legacy": {"wide": "images/2008/05/12/business/0512-biz-subclrCRAIGSLIST-1.jpg", "wideheight": "126", "widewidth": "190"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2008/05/12/business/12craig-span-600.jpg", "height": 326, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2008/05/12/business/12craig-span-600.jpg", "xlargeheight": "326"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2008/05/12/business/12craig-span-75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2008/05/12/business/12craig-span-75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Craigslist", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "eBay Inc", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Philanthropy", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Newspapers", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Computers and the Internet", "is_major": "N", "rank": "6", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Suits and Litigation", "is_major": "N", "rank": "7", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Noam", "lastname": "COHEN"}], "original": "By NOAM COHEN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-05-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Let's begin at the ending.

Her growing up years were in Wheaton, IL. She attended U of I Urbana Illinois. Then on to Penn State at State College Pennsylvania for her Masters in Liberal Arts and subsequently to New York City to pursue her career. After finding no work in her field of choice, writing for Theater Publications, she took what she referred to, as a job to pay the bills. The job, however, would become her lifelong career. Hired at Automobile Quarterly in 1963, as a secretary. Her first ride in an Old Car was from Times Square to the Worlds Fair in a 1903 Curved Dash Oldsmobile driven by Henry Austin Clark Jr., of Glen Cove, NY. She would remain at A.Q. until 1981. It is my opinion as well as others, that A.Q. would not have been as it grew to be without her skills, leadership and hard work. She went free lance, and also became the Editor for the Classic Car Club of America, a job she would fulfill for 26 plus years. Her first Book as a free lance author was The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942, with Henry Austin Clark Jr. The Book has become a must for Automotive Writers as well as Hobbyists through out the World. Her last Book just out is Walter L. Marr, Buick's Amazing Engineer. Her writings are so massive it would be hard to list them all here. For more about her google her: Beverly Rae Kimes.

She was referred to by Life Magazine as the ''nation's foremost automotive scholar'' ACD Club, bestow her Woman of The Year Award, CCCA with their Distinguished Service Award, Distinguished Service Citation from the Automotive Hall of Fame, she became the first historian to receive this award, A Lifetime Achievement Award as well as the Best of Books honor from IAM Awards.

Sarah Palin.I might have termed it \"artificial balance,\" but \"false equivalency\" works for me, too.For far too long we've heard \"fair and balanced\" when it could just as well have been termed \"irrelevant falsehoods mouthed by a spinmeister\" running in the same article or airing in the same broadcast as \"factual information from a candidate.\"Frankly, I'd welcome regulations requiring ads, speeches and press releases to present facts that can be verified from all political candidates, elected or appointed officeholders or chief executives.If we'd had them all along, our political landscape, our financial fortunes and our present world persona would be very different.Rita L. McKeeNew York, Sept. 21, 2008 \u25cf Reporters are not restricted to second-person reporting. Reporters are allowed to speak with their own voice. A reporter has a higher duty than a person being quoted by the reporter.People being quoted can indulge themselves in partiality. But a reporter, to maintain credibility, must attempt to report \"truthfully.\"The writer of an editorial is making a statement, which is understood to have some partiality to it. An editorial speaks with an editor's or a publisher's voice. And that voice does not have to present itself as impartial, as a reporter of facts, although it can.Jackie AldridgeAlameda, Calif., Sept. 21, 2008 \u25cf The quote attributed to The Times's executive editor, Bill Keller - \"We had to fit it into a manageable space\" - is just a defense mechanism in selective reporting to support a preconceived conclusion. Crossing the line between reporting and editorial comments in a news article leads to strengthening the decline of news reporting credibility and use of obvious distortions.Don TenerowiczEllington, Conn., Sept. 21, 2008\u25cf\u25cfRe \"Getting Past the Formalities\" (Sept. 14): It's very nice of you to admit that using Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein, three times on the front page on Aug. 28 was an \"overkill\" and that by not using John McCain's full name, John Sidney McCain III, in exactly the same situation, The Times was a tad inconsistent in its treatment of the two candidates.But are you certain of the reasons Mr. McCain's name was abbreviated where Mr. Obama's was not? Are you sure that it wasn't because Mr. McCain \"prefers\" to forget both Sidney and (even more) the fact that he's the third of the line? Or that by omitting it, The Times wasn't bowing to Mr. McCain's preferences?The Times has seemed to be heavily invested in the earth-moving business: make every molehill about Mr. Obama into a mountain and vice versa.Tamara P. DuvallLexington, Va., Sept. 14, 2008 \u25cf It's funny, a few months ago I had been reading The Times and had noticed, somewhat irritably, the use of \"Mrs.\" when referring to Hillary Clinton. I love the newspaper and trust it implicitly (this might not exactly be a good thing), but I was put off by the decision not to use the more P.C. \"Ms.\"Then I was annoyed when I noticed \"Ms. Palin,\" feeling that such considerations were wasted on someone so terrifying and - well, all those adjectives you want to use on her.I'm glad you answered this for me. If you hadn't addressed it, I doubt I would ever have had any clarification on this issue and maybe unfairly judged the paper's editors.Brianna SnyderSpringfield, Mass., Sept. 15, 2008\u25cf\u25cfRe \"The Scrutiny of Sarah Palin\" (Sept. 7): The Times has been absolutely correct in its scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin.After inflating Ms. Palin's family leadership role and small-town values into legitimate qualifications for the vice presidency, the McCain camp is now claiming that anyone who examines these areas has violated her family's privacy.The Times needs to look even deeper into Ms. Palin's scant record. The possibility that this woman might wield power over the entire country is terrifying.Thea AndersonLincoln, Mass., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf I don't buy your column.The coverage The Times has provided of Gov. Sarah Palin has been biased.It's O.K. to be biased. We all are, to some degree.What is not O.K. is when The Times refuses to admit it, or recognize it.Phil GrimmRogue River, Ore., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf The Times's coverage of Gov. Sarah Palin has been absolutely fair and totally needed.We are not living in the Joe McCarthy era of fear or the George W. Bush era of lies anymore. After The Times was initially hoodwinked by President Bush's invasion of Iraq, it vowed it would never shy away from investigating issues and getting to the truth of the matter.The Times vetted Barack Obama and now it is vetting Ms. Palin.This is a crucial election, so please, Times, continue to dig deep and report your findings accurately. We voters can handle the truth.Kathy BergerSan Anselmo, Calif., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf I concur with your take on unjustified Republican complaints about the scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin. Vice-presidential candidates are not vetted by the voters, so unless these candidates have visible public records, such as that of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., we are left to rely on what is released by campaign operatives - not the most reliable sources.Thus it is left to mainstream journalists to pose the serious questions about the candidates. In this case, the G.O.P. is merely seeking to embellish a paper-thin public record and head off potentially embarrassing questions.Had the McCain campaign properly investigated Ms. Palin, it would not be playing catch-up on this matter.Vaughn A. CarneyStowe, Vt., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf It is clear that the press must be even more vigilant in its job this political season.With Steve Schmidt in charge of the McCain campaign and his mentor, Karl Rove, manning a commentator's desk at Fox News, the people of American need to know more than ever who is spinning out the information contained in news stories.More often then not we see campaign and commentator remarks cut and pasted into news stories without attribution (such as Sarah Palin's claim that she said, \"Thanks but no thanks on that Bridge to Nowhere\") without providing the evidence to prove their veracity.Now more than ever, it is up to the press in our free and democratic society to root out the use of the press for political gain (propaganda). Don't let Mr. Rove and his disciples use the press to sell Ms. Palin and John McCain the same way they used the press to sell the Iraq war.Debra HollowayRye, N.H., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf Thank you to The Times for its continued efforts to give a whole picture of who Gov. Sarah Palin is. I hadn't realized how much the paper had already done.I appreciate your straightforward response about all of the recent criticism of The Times. At the moment there is nothing more important than informing the public before the election.In Ms. Palin we seem to have a hard-working, hard-hitting lady with some decent accomplishments and with exceptional looks (this is worthy of mention, as it seems to capture the imagination of the electorate). But there has been considerable stretching of the truth. She is in absolutely no way prepared to move into a position of power any greater than she presently has.I see many danger signs and can only hope (and expect) that The Times will continue the journalism we're seeing in regard to the vetting process.D. MandellSeattle, Sept. 7, 2008 \u25cf The Times is investigating Sarah Palin in order to analyze her judgment, understanding, persuasiveness to skeptics, contacts and other attributes necessary for success in the vice presidency and, potentially, the presidency.Attempting to undermine this investigation creates a reasonable inference of a motive to conceal.The honor of the investigative reporters of The Times needs no defending. At times, it is the judgment of editors that has come into question. There is no journalistic need to defend the reports of the investigation - its accuracy speaks for itself.But as a letter writer has asked, where is The Times in reporting whether the stated goals of the people running for the presidency and the vice presidency would allow them faithfully to carry out the oath of office to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\"?Robert LiebrossWestbury, N.Y., Sept. 7, 2008 \u25cf The response to the bashing of Gov. Sarah Palin in the news media always seems to be, \"We have a duty to ask questions,\" and then to add that Republicans don't like to be questioned.Reports on FactCheck.org, a University of Pennsylvania program, show that many of the \"questions\" the media are asking are lightly veiled attacks, often containing false accusations. There are hundreds of reporters asking similar \"questions.\" This is why people see such a powerful bias in much of the media.For example, CNN, in an interview on Sept. 4 with a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, asked how much of a problem it would be that Ms. Palin had significantly cut the budget in Alaska for special needs children. The reporter said she had been getting \"a lot of e-mails about the subject.\" But in fact, as FactCheck.org notes, Ms. Palin increased funding for special education dramatically.CNN could have spent less than five minutes in a Google search to know that the \"question\" was a false accusation.The news media does not start questions to Barack Obama with \"How does a radical Muslim terrorist like you expect to be able to attract American voters?\" But reporters don't hesitate to ask such questions of Republicans.Joe DennyWayne, Pa., Sept. 9, 2008 \u25cf Thank you to The Times for printing stories about Gov. Sarah Palin and for continuing to look into her record and positions. I want to know as much as possible before Election Day! I don't really get the people who think this should be off limits.Please don't let up. I especially appreciated the extremely informative article about the vetting process.Jen BinghamIndianapolis, Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cfYou provide an excellent defense of what should not have to be defended - journalists digging into the reality behind a campaign's spin.It's a shame that the McCain team has forced the news media to work overtime to compensate for its clearly sloppy vetting of its vice-presidential pick.I commend The Times for writing anything newsworthy that it finds out about a woman who is unknown to the American public but who has vaulted to celebrity status for the most superficial of reasons - her image.The woman could well be making executive decisions affecting all our lives. She has so far shown herself to be completely ill equipped to do so. It's the responsibility of all media to ignore appearances and get to the facts that will reveal the substance of this woman.Patty GrossmanBrooklyn, Sept. 7, 2008", "headline": {"main": "Letters: Making it Airtight, Formalities and Scrutiny", "kicker": "The Public Editor's Journal"}, "abstract": "Re \"Make It Airtight\" (Sept. 21): I was gratified to read that Richard Stevenson, the editor who directs The Times's coverage of the election, said that \"we don't want to fall into the trap of false equivalency\" when accurately reporting the false and misleading advertising, speeches and statements employed by Senator John McCain and his [...]", "print_page": null, "word_count": 1814, "_id": "4fd391bf8eb7c8105d8c2e7e", "snippet": "Re \"Make It Airtight\" (Sept. 21): I was gratified to read that Richard Stevenson, the editor who directs The Times's coverage of the election, said that \"we don't want to fall into the trap of false equivalency\" when accurately reporting the false...", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/letters-making-it-airtight-formalities-and-scrutiny/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Clark", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOYT"}], "original": "By CLARK HOYT"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2008-09-27T11:26:17Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Series", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine", "lead_paragraph": "Previously: The missing dog was found, though not the missing dog walker.

These ever-present screens have created an audience for very short moving pictures, as brief as three minutes, while cheap digital creation tools have empowered a new generation of filmmakers, who are rapidly filling up those screens. We are headed toward screen ubiquity. When technology shifts, it bends the culture. Once, long ago, culture revolved around the spoken word. The oral skills of memorization, recitation and rhetoric instilled in societies a reverence for the past, the ambiguous, the ornate and the subjective. Then, about 500 years ago, orality was overthrown by technology. Gutenberg's invention of metallic movable type elevated writing into a central position in the culture. By the means of cheap and perfect copies, text became the engine of change and the foundation of stability. From printing came journalism, science and the mathematics of libraries and law. The distribution-and-display device that we call printing instilled in society a reverence for precision (of black ink on white paper), an appreciation for linear logic (in a sentence), a passion for objectivity (of printed fact) and an allegiance to authority (via authors), whose truth was as fixed and final as a book.

Spelt, to my eye, didn't look like farro, and from a stovetop behavioral standpoint, it quickly distinguished itself. In a panic I called my personal farro expert, Jennifer DeVore, explaining I couldn't find farro so instead I bought. . . . ''Oh, no,'' she interrupted. ''You didn't buy spelt.'' Farro cooks in about 45 minutes; we cooked our spelt for four hours, and even then the result was extremely al dente. We threw in multiple sticks of butter, gallons of stock and $13 worth of grated Parmesan, but the spelt remained stoically flavor-impervious. We served it anyway. Contrary to the claims of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century spelt enthusiast, our guests did not find that eating it ''makes the spirit of man light and cheerful.''", "headline": {"main": "Grain Exchange", "kicker": "FOOD: THE WAY WE EAT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "65", "word_count": 1798, "_id": "4fd286cb8eb7c8105d857a0f", "snippet": "The New Year's Eve dinner party in question has since gone down in our family annals as the Night of the Great Spelt Screw-Up.

The economy may be tanking, but not Malcolm Gladwell. His new book, ''Outliers,'' a characteristically snappy look at what made the Beatles, Bill Gates and other superstars so successful, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. Bet on it to stay a while: ''The Tipping Point'' is still hanging out at No. 7 on the paperback nonfiction list after 216 weeks, and ''Blink,'' which spent 81 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list when it first appeared, has ridden the new book's coattails back onto the paperback list. According to rankings compiled last spring by Thomas H. Davenport, a management professor at Babson College, Gladwell is now the nation's fourth-most-influential business thinker, measured by Google hits, media references and academic citations. No. 1 on that list? Gary Hamel, a hospital administrator turned M.B.A. with a long list of publications and decidedly boring hair. Hamel gave the world ''core competencies'' and ''strategic intent.'' (He also wrote a book back in 2000 praising Enron for what he continues to call its ''uniquely entrepreneurial culture.'' Oops!) Writing recently in the magazine Intelligent Life, Adrian Wooldridge argued that the rise of ''journo-gurus'' like Gladwell and Thomas Friedman (No. 2 on Davenport's list) have upended the hierarchies of both journalism and gurudom, bumping political journalists out of first class while also stealing cheese from the likes of Tom Peters and Michael Porter.
