My second favorite way of looking at photos is in online slide shows. Slide shows began appearing on news sites like Slate.com a few years ago, before most sites could handle video.

Now all kinds of subjects get slide-show treatment, with substantial captions.

Seen in sequence, each face seemed to reflect a discrete facet of the day's ecstasy, catharsis and anxiety.", "headline": {"main": "Photo Negative", "kicker": "THE MEDIUM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "word_count": 1070, "_id": "4fd2b4b38eb7c8105d8a7221", "snippet": "Google misses an opportunity with its Life magazine archive.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-medium-t.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2009/03/01/magazine/01medium-600.jpg", "height": 342, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2009/03/01/magazine/01medium-600.jpg", "xlargeheight": 342}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "GOOGLE INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCRAPBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARCHIVES AND RECORDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PHOTOGRAPHY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Virginia", "lastname": "HEFFERNAN"}], "original": "By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-03-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Case Closed On Ocean Puzzle", "headline": {"main": "Case Closed on Ocean Puzzle", "kicker": "BITS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 277, "_id": "4fd28ba78eb7c8105d85f8cc", "snippet": "Case Closed     On Ocean Puzzle  ", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0DF153FF931A35750C0A96F9C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jenna", "lastname": "WORTHAM"}], "original": "By JENNA WORTHAM"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-03-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Business"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "Internet | \"At the exact moment Barack Obama was inaugurated, all traces of President Bush vanished from the White House Web site\" -- and that's a bad thing, writes the head of the British Library.

The captions are fanciful, the order is significant, the material is diverse. Good albums communicate a private urgency, and occasionally you even hit on something sinister, as when an ex-wife is conspicuously missing or a blacklisted face has been cropped out. For decades, a growing network of scrappers in America has refined and updated English commonplace books and turned scrapbooking into folk art. My second favorite way of looking at photos is in online slide shows. Slide shows began appearing on news sites like Slate.com a few years ago, before most sites could handle video. Many early slide shows featured runway fashion; you could see dozens of outfits instead of the select handful that might make it into the paper. Now all kinds of subjects get slide-show treatment, with substantial captions. Recently, on the Times site, lucid daylight portraits of people attending the Obama inauguration chronicled the event even better than live footage did.

Lately, however, since coming ''out of the closet as far as global warming is concerned,'' as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors' letter boxes and Dyson's own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described as ''a pompous twit,'' ''a blowhard,'' ''a cesspool of misinformation,'' ''an old coot riding into the sunset'' and, perhaps inevitably, ''a mad scientist.'' Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the mass cultivation of specially bred ''carbon-eating trees,'' whereupon the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded -- there are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford -- and suggested that ''perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can give directions to lost hikers.'' Dyson's son, George, a technology historian, says his father's views have cooled friendships, while many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else. There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the 20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone -- out of his beautiful mind. But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, Dyson's friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the case. ''His mind is still so open and flexible,'' Sacks says. Which makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose intelligence is revered by other scientists -- William Press, former deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him ''infinitely smart.'' Dyson -- a mathematics prodigy who came to this country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory -- not only did path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Witten, the ''high priest of string theory'' whose office at the institute is just across the hall from Dyson's. Yet instead of hewing to that fundamental field, Dyson chose to pursue broader and more unusual pursuits than most physicists -- and has lived a more original life.", "headline": {"main": "The Civil Heretic"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "32", "word_count": 8217, "_id": "4fd2b4b68eb7c8105d8a745b", "snippet": "How did Freeman Dyson, the world-renowned scientist and public intellectual, wind up opposing those who care most about global warming?", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "height": 400, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "xlargeheight": 400}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HANSEN, JAMES V"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SACKS, OLIVER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DYSON, FREEMAN J"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GORE, AL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PRINCETON UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GLOBAL WARMING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Nicholas", "lastname": "DAWIDOFF"}], "original": "By NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-03-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Science; Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine", "lead_paragraph": "How did Freeman Dyson, the world-renowned scientist and public intellectual, wind up opposing those who care most about global warming?", "headline": {"seo": "The Civil Heretic - Freeman Dyson - Profile", "main": "The Civil Heretic", "print_headline": "The Civil Heretic"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "32", "word_count": "8197", "_id": "5468a89a38f0d81e5cd0dd63", "snippet": "How did Freeman Dyson, the world-renowned scientist and public intellectual, wind up opposing those who care most about global warming?", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "height": 400, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29dyson-600.jpg", "xlargeheight": "400"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29cover-75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2009/03/29/magazine/29cover-75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Dyson, Freeman J", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Global Warming", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Princeton University", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Science and Technology", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Sacks, Oliver", "is_major": "N", "rank": "6", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Gore, Al", "is_major": "N", "rank": "7", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Hansen, James V", "is_major": "N", "rank": "8", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Nicholas", "lastname": "DAWIDOFF"}], "original": "By NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-03-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 19, "offset": 10, "time": 41}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

I felt relaxed and calm. Earlier that day I had attended a yoga workshop with a guru from India, then completed a writing assignment for a health and spirituality magazine about, as it happened, instinct - or antar-j\u00f1ana, inner knowledge. I opened the outer door to my vestibule, then crossed through its inner door and into my lobby, leaving my back to the entrance. I got a prickly feeling, I don't know why. I turned. There I saw, pushing open the inner door, an ink-black, gloved hand, exaggeratedly large, controlled and deliberate. It charged toward me. It was trailed by a body, the picture of death.It is difficult for me to render the horror of the image of that man entering my building lobby that night, so great is the disparity between its emotional charge for me now and the stereotypical, almost comical picture he presented. He was a figment from a nightmare. I guessed his height and weight at 6'3\" and 230 pounds, with the physicality of a boxer. The cops later told me that was right. His clothes were dark and innocuous - clean black jeans, black sneakers, a midnight-blue hoodie - as if chosen to leave no impression whatsoever. In contrast, on his face was a neoprene thermal ski mask, the type that tents in front to create a ridge and thus evokes to most anyone who's heard of him Darth Vader. I later discovered while searching on Google that this type of mask is favored by shoppers also enamored of vigilante-style military clothing and toy AK-47s - in other words it is meant to provoke a reaction. Of the figure's actual face I saw only slit-shaped, yellowed eyes and a broad, acned, coal-black forehead.", "headline": {"main": "The Art of Defying Death", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "abstract": "How yoga helped one woman survive an attack and its aftermath.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 1716, "_id": "4fd3980e8eb7c8105d8d1e46", "snippet": "How yoga helped one woman survive an attack and its aftermath.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/the-art-of-defying-death/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Elizabeth", "rank": 1, "lastname": "KADETSKY"}], "original": "By ELIZABETH KADETSKY"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2009-10-14T21:25:18Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "When it comes to the finer points of nature, I often feel at a loss.

It may not be a project that will make the world smaller or friendlier -- only, perhaps, a bit more precious. Not that the 11 shorts in ''New York, I Love You'' are all that bad. It's a nice-looking city, after all, even if the interstitial skyline and traffic montages assembled by Randy Balsmeyer are about as fresh as the postcards on sale in Times Square. Each vignette was shot in two days, and the roster of directing talent includes Mira Nair (''The Namesake'' and the forthcoming ''Amelia''), Fatih Akin (''Head-On'' and ''The Edge of Heaven'') and Natalie Portman, making her debut behind the camera.
