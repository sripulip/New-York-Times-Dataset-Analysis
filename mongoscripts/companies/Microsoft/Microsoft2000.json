There will always be a Harvard (and a Yale and a Princeton). But other traditional colleges are likely to be bypassed as students seek convenience and specially tailored services -- and colleges respond. The watchwords will be high technology and cost efficiency, and courses will be delivered in many ways. For better or worse, the future is full of niches to be filled. Here are some institutions that higher education experts expect to be on the cutting edge. UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX -- If there is a McDonald's of higher education, it is Phoenix. The name produces shudders among many educators, who say it does not offer the face-to-face interaction that has long characterized elite higher education. A for-profit institution with classrooms in 26 states, and more on the way, Phoenix has turned college education for older students into a mass-market commodity. It has 86,800 degree students, most concentrating in fields like business and technology (including 10,382 who take courses over the Internet). Phoenix employs mostly part-time faculty members to teach a standardized curriculum developed in central headquarters and presented in leased classrooms. MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, Cambridge, Mass. -- For the last half-century, the federal government has pumped billions of dollars into research universities to finance their expansion. With that growth ending, universities are looking elsewhere for support. Few have been as successful as M.I.T., which has formed partnerships with corporations ranging from Microsoft to Merrill Lynch for money, research and teaching opportunities. One visible model of that collaboration is its industry-supported Media Laboratory, where professors and students work side by side on high-technology projects. The British government recently tapped M.I.T. to work with Cambridge University and others to bolster their entrepreneurial spirit. ALVERNO COLLEGE, Milwaukee -- As students, professors and politicians seek clearer definitions of what a basic college education should include and how to measure the results, Alverno, a small Roman Catholic women's college, offers a breathtakingly simple approach to both. Its answer: students should learn eight sets of specific skills -- including communications, analysis, problem solving and social interaction -- and their progress should be monitored through regular assessment based on predetermined criteria. Their growth in public speaking, for example, might be judged by comparing videos from one year with those of previous years. Deceptively simple, but Alverno has won many awards and drawn a stream of corporate and educational visitors from as far away as Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi. RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, Troy, N.Y. -- Convinced that students were not learning as much as they should, R.P.I. turned its classrooms and its curriculum inside out. On entering a physics or calculus classroom, students plug their laptop computers into ports at their desks. A teacher lectures for 5 or 10 minutes, then asks students to solve problems using what they have just learned. Students cannot tune out. And by watching how students deal with problems on their computers, teachers can tell whether students grasp a concept or need more explanation. Rensselaer professors say their students learn fewer facts but have better command of material. TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY, Kirksville, Mo. -- In an era in which prestige is closely linked to the test scores of entering students, some public colleges have transformed themselves from run-of-the-mill, comprehensive institutions into increasingly selective ones. Among those that have come the furthest is Truman State, which evolved from Northeast Missouri State Teachers College into a small liberal arts version of flagship institutions like the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Michigan. Others include the College of New Jersey, formerly Trenton State, and the State University of New York at Geneseo. Truman State offers small classes and an honors program and continually tests its 6,000 students with national examinations to determine where it needs to improve instruction.", "headline": {"main": "Going Higher Tech Degree by Degree", "kicker": "VISIONS: CITIES"}, "abstract": "Among institutions of higher education that have developed a niche for themselves and are expected to be on cutting in 21st century include University of Phoenix, MIT, Alverno College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Truman State University; photo (M)", "print_page": "29", "word_count": 671, "_id": "4fd233c08eb7c8105d7c43c0", "snippet": "Despite warnings that too many people are overeducated, new high school graduates and adults long out of school are expected to flock to college in ever-growing numbers in the years ahead, even as the notion of higher education expands and changes....", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/education/visions-cities-going-higher-tech-degree-by-degree.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ALVERNO COLLEGE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FORECASTS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Karen", "middlename": "W.", "lastname": "Arenson", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Karen W.

The plaintiffs charge, in essence, that Microsoft has waged an unlawful campaign in defense of its monopoly position in the market for operating systems designed to run on Intel-compatible personal computers (''PC's''). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that Microsoft violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by engaging in a series of exclusionary, anticompetitive, and predatory acts to maintain its monopoly power. They also assert that Microsoft attempted, albeit unsuccessfully to date, to monopolize the Web browser market, likewise in violation of Section 2. Finally, they contend that certain steps taken by Microsoft as part of its campaign to protect its monopoly power, namely tying its browser to its operating system and entering into exclusive dealing arrangements, violated Section 1 of the Act.", "headline": {"main": "Excerpts From the Ruling That Microsoft Violated Antitrust Law", "kicker": "U.S. VS.

It would allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense system and would hold open the possibility of building a larger system in the future. At a news conference capping three days of talks, the Russian foreign minister said ''considerable differences'' remained, and he repeated that Russia believed the ABM treaty should ''remain a cornerstone of strategic stability.'' A1 British Rebuff to Zimbabwe Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he had told three Zimbabwean ministers that Britain would not provide extra money for land resettlement until squatters backed by Zimbabwe's government ended an occupation of hundreds of white-owned farms.

Dozens have been taken to hospitals in the Bahamas and Miami.

A13 Republicans Rethink Taiwan Bill Some Senate Republicans were pushing to postpone consideration of a bill that would upgrade military ties with Taiwan, asserting that it made no sense to pass the bill at a time when Taiwan's government was in transition and China had acted with relative restraint toward its neighbor. A11 World Briefing A6 NATIONAL A14-21 Officer Explains Reasoning For Use of Armed Agents Federal agents who staged the Elian Gonzalez raid in Miami carried automatic weapons into the house because intelligence reports had indicated that among those guarding the house were people with concealed-weapons permits, a history of violent crime or a record of anti-Castro violence, one of the officers said. A20 A federal appeals court put off a request by Elian's father to serve as his sole legal representative, but granted him the right to intervene in the battle over whether his son goes back to Cuba or stays here. But in a blow to Elian's Miami relatives, the court denied their request for regular visits with him and dismissed their request for the appointment of a neutral guardian. Instead, a psychiatrist and a social worker appointed by the government will monitor the boy and send the court reports on his condition and care.

He said he hoped to continue his Senate campaign, but would not make any decisions about the race until he had settled on a course of treatment, which includes radiation, hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of those options. Hillary Rodham Clinton had a brief telephone conversation with the mayor in which she wished him a speedy recovery. A1 Cancer experts said none of the therapies should interrupt his campaigning more than temporarily nor stop him from running for the Senate. B6 Unrecorded Police Searches Investigators for the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board determined that police officers routinely fail to file required paperwork after frisking or searching people on the street. The preliminary finding suggests that far more stop-and-frisk encounters may have taken place than were recorded in recent years. B1 U.S. Panel's Report Assailed Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir questioned the credibility of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and attacked critical findings of its draft report on the Police Department.

C21 BUSINESS DAY C1-20, 22 Inflation Rises to 3.2% The economy continued its robust growth in the first quarter, fueled by consumer spending, but inflation jumped mainly because of higher prices for fuel. Wall Street expressed concern that even as oil prices receded, labor costs would accelerate and keep the inflation rate rising. That raised the possibility that the Fed would increase short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next month, though most analysts expected it to stick to a quarter-point rate increase. A1 The Dow fell 57.40 points, or half a percent, to 10,888.10; the S.& P. 500 rose 3.93 points, to 1,464.92; but the Nasdaq climbed 143.94 points, or nearly 4 percent, to 3,774.03. C8 Rates Rise in Europe The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the fourth time in six months, to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent, but the common currency, the euro, nonetheless plunged to 91 cents against the dollar, a low.

A4 Iran Cleric Defends Crackdown Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a leading Iranian cleric and former president, defended the recent closing of 16 pro-reform publications and accused them of trying to destroy the country's religious underpinnings.

With his speech at a national conference of black mayors, Mr. Gore sought to answer critics who have said his proposals simply pour more money into failing school systems. A10 Bush Picks Campaign Chief Donald L. Evans, a Texas oil and gas businessman who presided over the record fund-raising drive for Gov. George W. Bush in the Republican primaries, was named chairman of the presidential campaign. Mr. Evans, 53, has had little conventional political involvement, but he has known Governor Bush well for 25 years.

There was little sector-wide news or sweeping economic data to grab the market's attention. A late-day selling spree pressured the Dow Jones industrial average, but the blue-chip indicator kept its head above water on a gain in General Motors after a bullish comment by an analyst. The Dow rose 7.54 points, to 10,777.28. Investors pulled cash out of nearly every technology sector, dragging the Nasdaq composite index down 106.25 points, or 2.91 percent, to 3,538.71. The index ended at its session low as bellwether shares languished. Broader measures of the market struggled throughout the session. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 10.59 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,437.21. The Wilshire 5000 index, which reflects nearly the entire equity market, fell 137.07 points, or 1.02 percent, to 13,280.60. Trading was light, extending a series of sluggish sessions as the lure of summer pulled players away from the market, analysts said. Stocks should hover in this trading range until volume picks up to ignite a sustainable rally, they added. While inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings ebbed in their influence on the market, brokerage research and news from individual companies grabbed the spotlight. ''It's specific company news,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for the John Hancock Funds. ''It's specific news from around the world that might impact some industry. It's all those classic stories that are inherently unpredictable.'' General Motors buoyed the Dow average, climbing 2 7/8, to 89 3/8, after Merrill Lynch named G.M.'s Hughes Electronics as its Focus One stock. Hughes rose 4, to 92 1/4. Both stocks were among the most actively traded. The shares of WorldCom fell in response to news reports that said the government might reject its merger with its telecommunications rival, Sprint. WorldCom, the second most actively traded issue on Nasdaq, fell 2 7/16, to 39 9/16. On the New York Stock Exchange, Sprint shares dropped 1 3/4, to 56 1/4. Microsoft, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average and the third most-active Nasdaq stock yesterday, slipped 1 1/2, to 66 3/16, after the government said the company's offer to change its business practices would do nothing to stop it from violating antitrust law. Cisco Systems slid 2 5/8, to 55 3/8. ''We need a lot more good news to get a sustainable move to new highs for this market,'' said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D. A. Davidson & Company. ''You don't have a lot of direction in the market right now until volume builds up,'' Mr. Volk said. ''And I think until you get volume on the upside in the stocks that have been the leaders, you're going to see some choppiness.'' Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 808.7 million shares, while Nasdaq logged volume of 1.25 billion shares. ''I think that we saw the high-water mark,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. ''We just have to recognize that the period from October to March was so huge that volume increased 50 percent to 75 percent. ''We're going nowhere. We're going sideways,'' he said. ''Obviously, the catalyst for higher prices is some kind of conviction by investors that interest rates aren't going to be going up much more than they already expect.'' Bond prices fell, with the 10-year Treasury bond down 11/32, to 99 24/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.53 percent from 6.48 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond was down 18/32, to 100 12/32, while the yield rose to 6.22 percent from Wednesday's close at 6.18 percent.

Leo plays shortstop in a softball league in Geneva, Ill., outside Chicago. As a batter, he is no Mark McGwire, having hit just one home run last year. But he often gets on base -- a good analogy to his investing style as lead manager of the $2.51 billion Northern Technology fund. ''Our focus is on consistent, above-average growth companies, like baseball players who hit steady singles and doubles,'' Mr. Leo said from his office in downtown Chicago. ''We're more than happy to stumble on a home run, like the next Microsoft, but those are few and far between.'' His base hits have been consistent. Northern Technology returned 69.1 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through June 2, compared with 53.8 percent for its peers in the technology fund category, according to Morningstar Inc. Mr. Leo, 38, works with a co-manager, George J. Gilbert, and four technology analysts to pick the 60 to 85 stocks that the fund holds. The team members keep a close eye on the companies in their specific industry sectors. ''We're bottoms-up analysts,'' Mr. Leo said. ''We're always kicking the tires of the companies that have the growth characteristics that we're looking for.'' The most basic of these is annual earnings and sales growth rates of at least 25 percent. Also key is the size of the company's market, and how that market is expected to grow over the next three to five years. ''In technology, unlike other industries, new market niches are developing all the time,'' Mr. Leo said. The team also reviews a company's competitive position in terms of potential market share -- the bigger the better. But each sector is evaluated differently. ''In some sectors, being first on the market with a new product or service is important,'' he said. ''Other sectors are growing so rapidly that you can own two or four companies in the same business because the tide is so strong that all of them can thrive.'' Mr. Leo wants to see expansion in gross profit margins, and even more important, in operating margins. Strength in that area, he said, often indicates that a company has operating efficiencies and price leverage. He figures that the team members spend about 20 percent of their time talking to management, who should include what he calls ''true technologists -- people who can see what the next generation of technology will require and how to get the company to that point.'' Of course, the team reviews company documents and reports, as well as Wall Street research. They also talk to suppliers, customers and other intermediaries to gauge a company's competitive position. For most software companies and other fast-growing concerns, he looks at the price-to-sales multiple. For most semiconductor companies, which operate in a fairly mature, cyclical market, he checks the price-to-earnings ratio. The key question in today's market, of course, is what constitutes excessive valuation. ''It's pretty hard to pick the top in technology stocks,'' Mr. Leo conceded. Still, he said, ''we're a little concerned that some valuations in some parts of the market are aggressive, unless companies are doubling their sales growth year over year.'' That kind of revenue growth is occurring among some communications-related semiconductor, optical networking and Internet-related software companies, he added. But in other areas, like e-tailing, valuations can be ahead of the growth. MR. LEO likes Veritas Software, which helps businesses manage their data storage. ''The explosion in Internet-driven and computer networking data has combined to create an extremely high growth rate for storage capacity needs,'' he said. The company's software is unusual, he added, because it ties together networks cobbled from different hardware providers. He forecasts Veritas's three-year earnings growth rate at 50 percent, annualized, and says it will dominate its market with sales of $10 billion five years hence, versus $596.1 million in 1999. He bought shares in November at $53. They now trade at $135.6875, or 46 times his sales-per-share estimate of $2.96 for 2000. Another pick is Applied Micro Circuits of San Diego, which makes semiconductors for the telecommunications and data networking industries. Its sales are being driven by businesses that are building high-speed Internet networks, Mr. Leo said, adding that the company is the market leader in providing telecommunications equipment companies with chips used in wide area networks. He expects the company's earnings to grow 45 percent, annualized, over the next three years, and puts the size of its potential market at $100 billion in five years. Mr. Leo first bought shares in November at $44 and added more last week as shares dipped on concerns over slowing sales growth to a large customer; they now trade at $105.75, or 54.5 times his estimate of $1.94 in sales per share for 2000. A longtime holding is JDS Uniphase of San Jose, Calif., a maker of fiber optic networking gear. The company has solidified a leadership position by making several strategic acquisitions over the last few years, Mr. Leo said. It is currently acquiring E-Tek Dynamics, a San Jose electrical components maker. He expects earnings growth of 45 percent, annualized, over the next three years and figures that JDS operates in a market of $25 billion to $30 billion in three years. He bought shares in February, 1998 for the equivalent of $5 each; they now trade at $110.5625, or 59 times his sales-per-share estimate of $1.87 for this year.", "headline": {"main": "Northern Technology Fund", "kicker": "INVESTING WITH: JOHN B.

A6 U.S. and Russian Missile Plan Russia and the United States will hold a joint defense exercise against short- and medium-range missiles, an American official said.

A9 Iraqi Storms U.N. Office An Iraqi man brandishing two machine guns and explosives shot his way into a United Nations office in Baghdad, Iraq, killing 2 people, wounding 7 and taking about 50 hostage.

A1 Boy Scouts Can Bar Gays The Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in a New Jersey case, said the Boy Scouts may exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of their ''expressive message.'' A1 House Endorses Drug Benefit The House passed a bill offering prescription benefits to 39 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare, but only after Democrats walked off the floor to express frustration at being unable to get a full debate on a proposal to establish more extensive drug coverage. A1 Campaign Finance Legislation The House overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation to require tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political advocacy to disclose their activities and donors. A21 Defending Gore on Fund-Raising President Clinton, in a wide-ranging news conference, defended Vice President Al Gore against accusations of campaign finance irregularities, saying that Mr. Gore had made ''a compelling case'' that he did nothing wrong. A21 No Pass for Reagan Attacker A Washington psychiatric hospital withdrew its recommendation that a court let John W. Hinckley Jr. leave the hospital for unsupervised weekly visits with his parents. A18 California Official Steps Down Chuck Quackenbush resigned as insurance commissioner rather than risk impeachment over accusations that he diverted millions in earthquake insurance settlements. A18 EDUCATION Parochial School Aid Allowed The Supreme Court ruled, 6 to 3, that a federal program that puts computers and other ''instructional equipment'' in parochial school classrooms does not violate the separation between church and state.

The Fed's decision to keep the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent had been widely expected. Still, stocks of financial services companies, which stand to benefit if interest rates stabilize or start to fall, were the standout performers. ''This is what the market wanted to see,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''The view is that we are now in a friendlier rate environment.'' Indeed, after reading the central bank's so-called policy directive, analysts said that the Fed was not likely to prove threatening to stock investors, at least for the next few months. ''Given what we know today, the consensus view is that the Fed has finished raising interest rates for the year,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities. Led by J. P. Morgan, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,139.15. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.06, or 0.1 percent, to 3,958.21. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.35, or 0.1 percent, to 1,498.13. Before the Fed made its midafternoon announcement, major market gauges were all solidly higher. But selling set in after the news was reported. ''We had the potential for a pullback no matter what the Fed did because the market has had a good month,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''It is too early to say the Fed is done for the year, but unless we get really bad inflation numbers, I suspect the Fed will be on hold until after the election.'' Financial service stocks, especially banks, did well. J. P. Morgan rose $3.56, to $148.50. Chase Manhattan gained $1.56, to $52.50, while Citigroup advanced 69 cents, to $77.31, and Wells Fargo rose $1.19, to $45.56. Technology stocks were mixed. Nortel Networks, a component of the S.& P. 500, gained $2.13, to $83. Intel managed its eighth consecutive gain, rising 6 cents, to $72.13. And Microsoft rose 63 cents, to $71.25. Cisco Systems fell 69 cents, to $64.81, however. Qualcomm shed $2.38, to $56.63, and Dell Computer dropped $1.31, to $37.44. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained $1.19, to $33.81, after Goldman, Sachs lifted its third-quarter profit estimate. But forest products companies fell after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lowered profit estimates for this year and for 2001. International Paper fell 44 cents, to $32.31. Weyerhaeuser dropped $1.31, to $46.88, and Temple Inland fell $1.25, to $43.69. Medtronic had a bad day, falling $3.13, to $49.69, after the world's largest pacemaker manufacturer reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations. But most biotechnology stocks moved higher. Amgen closed at $69.06, up $1.81. Genentech gained $6, to $171. Chiron rose $1.63, to $50.13. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals closed at $115.14, up $3.20. -------------------- Treasury Prices Mixed By Bloomberg News Bond prices were mixed yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged and warned about the risks of faster inflation. Treasuries did not get a lasting bounce because ''the Fed hasn't uncovered its next move,'' said William Fitzgerald of Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Still, investors may buy on the notion that the Fed is near the end of its cycle of rate increases, even if it is not finished, he said. ''Many investors believe the Fed usually raises rates one time too many,'' he said. The 10-year note rose 1/32, to 99 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.77 percent from 5.78 percent. The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 107 22/32.

Bush's presidential debates proposal, said they had no intention of carrying debates sponsored by rival networks like NBC and CNN. The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks, has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the panel created in 1987 by Democrats and Republicans to avoid squabbling over debates. Since the creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far to circumvent its work. The panel's executive director said she still hoped to negotiate an agreement under which Mr. Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.

A22 Mr. Gore, accompanied part of the way by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, concluded a 28-hour campaign swing that included stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Kentucky. A22 The Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and considered supporting Ralph Nader in the general election, has decided to endorse Mr. Gore, officials of the group said. A23 Congressional Priorities Members of Congress return from recess this week for a final session compressed by the election campaigns and dominated by tax cuts, education, health care and government spending. The Republican majority's first step will be to try to override President Clinton's vetoes of the repeal of the marriage tax and the estate tax, but they are not expected to be successful. A1 Judge's Doubts in Spy Case The federal judge who tried to release the fired nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee from jail on $1 million bail said in a written opinion that he was no longer convinced that Dr. Lee had downloaded some of the country's most sensitive nuclear secrets. The judge had ordered Dr. Lee freed on bail on Friday, but an appeals court halted the release while it considered a government appeal.

A1 SPORTS D1-10 Sampras and Williams Win Pete Sampras weathered a rain delay and an early challenge from Hyung-Taik Lee to advance to the United States Open quarterfinals with a 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4 victory. D1 Serena Williams, the defending Open champion, survived a first-set tie breaker to defeat Jelena Dokic, 7-6 (7), 6-0, to move into the quarterfinals. D4 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 In Holiday Campaigning, One Walks and One Talks Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio were miles apart, in geography and approach, for the traditional start of the general election campaign. Mrs. Clinton marched in the West Indian American Carnival Day Parade in Brooklyn but gave no speeches or news conferences. Mr. Lazio marched upstate, attended a fair and held two news conferences in which he contrasted himself with his Senate opponent on issues and qualifications. B1 Parade Thrives Despite Ban The city's ban on alcohol sales at the West Indian parade did not seem to dampen the spirits of participants or the thousands who came to watch. B5 Bronx Evangelical Rally Several thousand Latino evangelicals endured rain and delays to hear the Rev. Yiye Avila, a 74-year-old Puerto Rican who is a force in the conversion of hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic Latinos to evangelical Protestant denominations. B1 EDUCATION Teacher Shortage Persists New York City's 1.1 million public school children return to class on Thursday to face a worsening shortage of qualified teachers, even as tougher standards make the path to graduation more arduous. Most of the 150 or so certified-teacher vacancies in failing elementary schools have been filled, but by Friday officials were still well short of filling 250 such openings at the lowest-performing middle and high schools, as required by a court order. A1 Strike Looms in Philadelphia The union representing 21,000 city teachers said it would ask members to authorize a strike in a vote today, citing a lack of progress in negotiations on several issues. The 200,000 children in the system are to return to class on Thursday. A18 SCIENCE TIMES F1-12 Debate on Cholesterol Drugs New research indicates that even more people should be on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, like young men with high cholesterol levels. But some experts caution that the drugs are too new and too expensive and their side effects still too uncertain to prescribe them widely.

G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Its shares fell 69 cents, to $51.38. Ford had already announced that its output would be down 10 percent. And while Chrysler has not disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make fewer cars by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time. [Page C2.] Senate Approves Bankruptcy Bill The Senate approved a major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws, passing legislation by an overwhelming margin that makes it harder for people to seek legal protection from payment of their debts. But the bill's prospects for becoming law are uncertain at best because Congress may not get the opportunity to override President Clinton's threatened veto before lawmakers adjourn for the year.

[C7.] Motorola to Fall Shy of Estimates Motorola said that it would fall short of Wall Street's sales and profit projections for the current quarter because of sharply reduced demand for its chips and continuing profit margin erosion in its cell phone business. [C3.] High-Profile TV Shows Canceled Three broadcast networks moved to shake up their prime-time schedules, canceling several of the most publicized new programs of the season, including NBC's ''The Michael Richards Show'' and Fox's ''The Street.'' Taken with other cancellations announced recently, and sliding ratings for some other heavily anticipated series, the new television season, which began with promise, is now listing badly as it heads for its midseason changes.
