All Rights Reserved."}{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "Question", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Circuits", "lead_paragraph": "Q. I enjoy books on CD's and would like to listen to them on my iPod. I can import the CD's into my iTunes music software and create MP3 files of the readings, but I don't see any way to bookmark a file when I stop listening to it in my iPod. Does the iPod offer a bookmark function? A. The iPod, Apple Computer's portable player for digital music files, has a built-in bookmark function that can hold your place in an audio book, but the feature works only with files in the Audible format. Audible files, which have a file extension of .aa, include audio books, radio programs and other spoken-word content and are available at www.audible.com. The Audible bookmark feature does not typically work with MP3 files, including those you make yourself from audio book CD's. But if you press the iPod's pause button and allow the device to go into sleep mode, it will usually resume playing the audio file at the point where you left off. This is not a wholly reliable feature because buttons can be pushed accidentally, and switching between songs or connecting the iPod to a computer will cause it to lose your place in an audio book. Another way to return to your place in an audio file is to note the time code displayed on the iPod's screen when you press Stop. When you resume listening, the recording will begin to play from the beginning. Press the round Select button in the middle of the iPod's scroll wheel, then rotate the wheel to advance quickly through the file to return to the time you noted. Pressing the iPod's Next/Fast Forward button while a file is playing will also enable you to advance it quickly through a song or audio book. Audible.com has a large collection of content to download at a variety of prices. Audible files mesh well with Apple's iTunes music program for Macintosh and can also be used with the new Windows iPod with the latest iPod software and Audible's AudibleManager software (www.audible.com/software). Q. Is there a place on the Web that offers free downloads of electronic books in the public domain? A. More than 6,200 complete electronic books are available for downloading from the library of Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.net). The collection includes Shakespeare's plays, ''Frankenstein'' by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, a selection of Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and thousands of other literary works. Most of the books and electronic texts available from Project Gutenberg date from before 1923, so their copyrights have expired. They come in the form of plain text files that are usually compressed in the Zip format for faster downloading. Once you download a book, you can read it on a computer in any text-editing or word-processing program, print it out or transfer it to a personal organizer or other device that can display text files. Project Gutenberg accepts donations of money and time from volunteers who are willing to type in or proofread additions to the collection. Q. Microsoft Word has the largest share of the word processing market over all, but not within the legal profession, where Corel's WordPerfect is the leader. What features make WordPerfect more attractive to lawyers and their staffs? A. Several factors are probably involved. WordPerfect became a standard program in many law offices back in the days of DOS, and Corel produces a version geared specifically to the needs of legal word-processing. Although Word pulled ahead of WordPerfect in terms of market share as the Windows operating system took hold in the 1990's, some lawyers find that WordPerfect handles footnotes and endnotes far more reliably. WordPerfect's Reveal Codes feature, which allows you to see precisely how text is formatted, also has many devotees. A Web site called WordPerfect vs. Word (www.wpvsword.com) devotes itself to meticulous comparison of the features of each program's latest version.

ATI said it had entered a technology agreement with Microsoft to develop ''custom, leading-edge graphics technologies'' for the console. ''We selected ATI after reviewing the top graphics technologies in development and determining that ATI's technical vision fits perfectly with the future direction of Xbox,'' Robbie Bach, senior vice president of Microsoft's home and entertainment division, said. The announcement ends months of speculation over whether Nvidia, the leading maker of graphics processors for PC's, would renew its troubled partnership with Microsoft on the Xbox. The graphics processor is the most expensive component in the Xbox, and Nvidia stood poised for a major windfall after the chipmaker won the contract shortly after the Xbox was announced three years ago. But sales problems and hardware changes left Nvidia with piles of unsold and unusable chips, putting it in a position where it could have lost money on the console if it had not submitted the Microsoft contract to arbitration. The Xbox deal has accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of Nvidia's sales the last two years, and company executives credited Xbox-related business for a surge in profit during Nvidia's most recent quarter. Analysts had predicted the contract for the next Xbox might go to ATI, which also makes the graphics processor for Nintendo's GameCube. Microsoft has yet to set a date or reveal details on the successor to the current Xbox, despite rampant speculation from fans and game makers. While Microsoft will need to deliver new technology that can compete with Sony's successor to the PlayStation 2, it is also probably looking for ways to cut costs after after taking significant losses on the Xbox.

The experience of watching a PowerPoint presentation is meant to be the same in a San Francisco conference room as it is in a Chang Mai Internet cafe. And in either setting, PowerPoint's graphic identity might not literally be invisible, but like the buzzing fluorescent light that office workers eventually tune out, after a while you just don't see it.

In both mediums, Mr. Byrne, who is best known as a musician but who was trained as an artist, subjects PowerPoint's characterless graphic templates to a radical metamorphosis. Arrows that curve out of their trajectory and into psychedelic rainbow-colored curlicues, surreal charts that satirize postmodern posturing, typographical compositions that present absurd abstractions with straight-faced conviction and deadpan photographs of the most humdrum of everyday objects all morph into one another with the steady pacing of a corporate sales conference.", "headline": {"main": "David Byrne's Alternate PowerPoint Universe", "kicker": "ART/ARCHITECTURE"}, "abstract": "Veronique Vienne reviews new David Byrne art project Envisioning Emotional Epistemological Information, boxed set containing book and DVD; photos (M)", "print_page": "26", "word_count": 936, "_id": "4fd243c78eb7c8105d7dd96d", "snippet": "POWERPOINT, the ubiquitous Microsoft business application, is not meant to be looked at too closely.

Citing ''a substantial outcry from a widespread segment of the affected industry,'' Stephen G. Kunin, a deputy patent commissioner, ordered the agency's examiners to reconsider the patent they awarded in November 1998 to three researchers at the University of California. Mr. Kunin described the case as ''an extraordinary situation.'' The patent office has ordered such re-examinations only 151 times since 1981, and it issues about 180,000 patents a year. The patent -- No.5,838,906 -- affects how Internet sites build into Web pages small interactive programs that power everything from banner ads to interactive customer service. Eolas Technologies Inc., which was founded by one of the inventors and has licensed the patent exclusively, has begun enforcing its claims and recently won a $520 million jury award against Microsoft, which quickly appealed the judgment. Eolas said Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser -- used by the vast majority of Internet users -- violated its patent. Microsoft has pledged to redesign its browser early in 2004 in ways that will require Web surfers to click on a dialog box when they visit a site that uses one of the specialized programs. Last month, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, urged the patent office to re-examine the patent's validity. Mr. Berners-Lee said he worried that Microsoft's redesign ''would render millions of Web pages and many products of independent software developers incompatible.'' He also feared that Web developers would respond with their own tweaks that ignore long-standing Web standards.", "headline": {"main": "Technology Briefing | Internet: Disputed Net Patent To Be Re-Examined"}, "abstract": "US Patent and Trademark Office, in unusual move, is reconsidering patent awarded in November 1998 to three researchers at University of California affecting Web pages that critics contend could disrupt millions of sites; patent affects how Internet sites build into Web pages small interactive programs that power everything from banner ads to interactive customer service; Eolas Technologies Inc, which was founded by one of inventors and has licensed patent exclusively, has begun enforcing its claims and recently won $520 million jury award against Microsoft, which quickly appealed ruling; Eolas says Microsoft's Internet Explorer violated its patent; Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, has urged patent office to re-examine patent's validity (M)", "print_page": "3", "word_count": 272, "_id": "4fd248d58eb7c8105d7e595a", "snippet": "In an unusual move, the United States Patent and Trademark Office is reconsidering a patent affecting Web pages that critics contend could disrupt millions of sites.
