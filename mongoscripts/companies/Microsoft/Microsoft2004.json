Sometimes the concentration of effort mainly ends up underscoring how hard it can be to solve a given problem, like controlling spam or designing laptop batteries that last as long as they should. At other times, the problem everyone is tackling yields to steady year-by-year technological progress. Disk drives and other storage devices grow ever cheaper and more reliable. Transmission speeds over modems keep going up. But often such races result in true breakthroughs that make computers much more useful and creates countless opportunities for follow-on innovations and products.

The Atlantis is home to more than 1,400 slot machines, but so vivid is the mental snapshot that Baerlocher, 35, carries in his head that he immediately registers the presence of a new machine on the floor. Although Baerlocher is a trained mathematician, his interest is far from academic. He is the chief game designer for the country's largest maker of slot machines, International Game Technology of Reno. At the first sign of a new slot machine from a competitor, he goes into action. ''Give me 30 minutes and $60,'' he says, ''and I can tell you pretty much anything you want to know about another company's machine.'' At 8 p.m. on a warm midsummer's night, Baerlocher watched a woman dressed in green polyester pants and a yellow-and-white-striped short-sleeved top play a slot machine he designed called ''The Price Is Right.'' At first, the woman's body language was noncommittal: she stood half-turned from the game, as if no more than mildly curious about the outcome of her wager. ''Price'' is what slot pros call ''a cherry dribbler,'' a machine that dispenses lots of small payouts while it nibbles at your stash rather than biting off large chunks of it. ''You want to give the newbie lots of positive reinforcement -- to keep 'em playing,'' Baerlocher told me. As if on cue, the woman hit a couple of small jackpots and took a seat.

But, mainly, they are struggling with the longstanding reality that it is harder to put an exact price on intellectual or creative effort than on, say, a bushel of wheat. Information is both invaluable and impossible to value. Historically, the main way around this problem has been to pack the results of intellectual or creative effort into something tangible that can be priced and sold: a book, a seat in a theater, an hour of an expert's time. Technology causes economic chaos when it disrupts this packaging plan, as is now happening in the music industry. Ten years ago, if you wanted to play a song, you had to buy a CD or a tape. Now, thanks to downloaded MP3 files, you don't -- and the chaos is all the worse because the same young audience that would otherwise be buying the most CD's is the quickest to adopt MP3's.

UPDATED CLASSICS: PARIS N HELS 4EVER -- Homer's ancient Greek poem ''The Iliad,'' the basis for the Hollywood blockbuster ''Troy,'' has been compressed for a new generation too lazy to see the film let alone read the 24-book epic that runs to more than 15,000 lines, Reuters reported. The first five books of the centuries-old tale, set in the final year of the Trojan War, which began when the Trojan Paris snatched Helen from Greece, are now available in the language people use when sending instant messages, Microsoft (MSFT.O) said yesterday. Book II is reduced to just 24 words of messenger speak, losing some of the lyricism of the original: ''Agamemnon hd a dream: Troy not defended. Ordered attack! But Trojans knew they were coming n were prepared. Achilles sat sulking in his tent.'' The translation is not written in Homer's dactylic hexameter, but it does use emoticons to emphasize intense moments.

As he departed, he told a reporter he wanted to sit down and relax with a glass of wine and a blank sheet of paper. This was perhaps not so true: it's hard to imagine Joy with a blank sheet of paper. Thoughts and ideas pile up furiously in his notebooks; diagrams and scribbles and equations issue forth at all hours of the day and night. When Joy, 49, finally moved out of a small Sun office in downtown Aspen, where he had worked since the late 1980's, he had to archive 900 pounds of professional papers. Then it took him months to go through his personal records, which filled 20 fireproof file cabinets. Over the past few months, Joy has been splitting his time between a new house in Marin County, Calif., and his main home in Aspen, where his two children go to school. ''I'm in an in-between thing,'' he says. Indeed, there are at least two Bill Joys. Start with Joy the computer scientist -- or computer architect, as he often describes himself -- a Silicon Valley deity, generally regarded as one of the most gifted engineers ever to have negotiated freeway traffic. Much of the present-day Internet is built upon the Unix code Joy wrote in the 1970's when he was a grad student at Berkeley; after that, his signature inventions shaped the Java programming language and the Sun computer servers that power a good portion of the Web. This Bill Joy recently flirted with the idea of taking a job at Google and continues to entertain pitches from friends and strangers eager to have him join their start-ups. The challenge is to find the right one.

As in real life, though, troops were dodging gunfire. I was at the Institute for Creative Technologies in Marina Del Rey, Calif., playing a new X box video game called Full Spectrum Warrior. Leading eight men in an Army squad on a patrol of the war-torn city, I got a taste, however approximate, of why Iraq is such a hard place to be a soldier these days. My job, as squad leader, was to order my soldiers where to go and what to do. First, I sent half of my men into an alleyway, where they immediately came under fire from insurgents hiding nearby. Scrambling for safety, I ordered us to duck into a building, pausing to marvel at the detail of the architecture. I then led us back out onto the street, directing my team to crouch behind a car while we tried to locate the snipers. This was a bad idea. Despite what you see in action movies and other video games, cars do not provide good cover from bullets. The snipers cut loose, and my troops crumpled to the ground. It was surprisingly distressing. In barely three minutes, I had led every single one of my soldiers to his death. I play video games regularly and, modesty aside, usually do quite well. Though this was my first attempt at Full Spectrum Warrior, the reason that I played poorly was not that I was inexperienced but that the game was not designed solely for entertainment. Full Spectrum Warrior was created by the Institute for Creative Technologies, with help from the Army, to teach soldiers realistic strategies for surviving what the armed forces call ''military operations in urban terrain.'' As a result, the game is unforgivingly precise. The soldiers you command are programmed to respond the way a real soldier would. There are no magic weapons to bail you out. All you have going for you is the real world. ''This is what you'll really see when you're out there,'' said Maj.

The award is about $35 million more than what Microsoft suggested in court filings. The California suit, filed in 2000, accused Microsoft of overcharging for PC software by maintaining a monopoly over its Windows operating system. The case was settled last year. Microsoft has settled similar suits in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Consumer suits are still pending in Iowa, Nebraska, New York and Wisconsin. ''We think the judge did a very thoughtful job, carefully and properly applying California law, and the class counsel received a fair award,'' a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said. The award includes $101 million in fees and $11.5 million in expenses to be shared among lawyers at 31 law firms, including Townsend & Townsend & Crew, based in San Francisco. Under the antitrust settlement, California purchasers of Microsoft products will receive vouchers ranging from $5 to $29 that can be used to buy any manufacturer's personal-computer hardware or software. Two-thirds of the unclaimed vouchers will go to California schools in low-income areas.

And from the moment Halo 2 finally went on sale, gamers have burned countless hours mastering Halo 2's fancy new weapons and exploring its expanded humans-repel-alien-invaders narrative. But for filmmakers like Burnie Burns, who work in the emerging medium of machinima, these features are a mere starting point. Instead of playing Halo as intended, Mr. Burns and a crew of machinima peers exploit the game's software quirks to create their online comedy series, Red vs. Blue, within Halo's virtual world. Since its debut in the spring of 2003, Red vs. Blue has rivaled Halo itself in popularity; fans download new episodes (www.redvsblue.com) at a rate of over 900,000 a week. GREG ALLEN GREG ALLEN -- How did you start making short films inside a video game? BURNIE BURNS -- I made a 16-millimeter, then the guys I made it with left for L.A. I stayed [in Austin, Tex.] working for a technology company, and basically, I needed a way to write and produce stuff myself. That's when I had the idea. Q -- How do you pronounce machinima? It's one of those words that nobody ever says out loud. A -- I've heard it pronounced both mah-SHIH-ni-ma and mah-SHEE-ni-ma. Q -- What's the basic machinima process? A -- One player in a game is literally a cameraman; you're recording through that character's eyes. It looks like animation, but it's really a lot like live action. You block out a scene and do takes. Then you edit it and dub your own dialogue. Machinima kind of starts when you stop playing. Halo is a virtual world; a character's programmed to talk or shoot when a player enters the room, but what happens right after the player leaves? He's still in there. Q -- So you're exploring the inner lives of these faceless, armor-clad warriors? A -- Exactly. We imagined our own characters and storyline. Sometimes it intersects with the Halo story, like the episode when Sarge calls [their vehicle] the Warthog, and the others think it looks like a puma. But mostly we just tell our own stories. Q -- One of the trademarks of Red vs. Blue is Halo's spare, almost Beckettian landscape. How does Halo 2, which is more elaborate, change things for you? Is it like when they try to revitalize a sitcom by redecorating? A -- Yeah, or relocating, like when Laverne & Shirley moved to California. [The Halo 2 developers at Bungie] have their own storyline, but we'll still do the absurdist existential comedy. They've upgraded the world; the lighting's different, the rocks are different. They've rendered the characters in much higher detail. But the main thing for us is the new models; now you can control the aliens like you control the marines. So we can do real-world parallels of wars or cultural differences. Q -- It's surprising that Microsoft let Red vs. Blue stay alive. They could've choked it in its crib. A -- [Laughs] They still could. But the guys from Bungie contacted us right away -- they saw it starting at Episode 1 or 2 -- and said they liked it a lot and wanted to make sure we were protected.

Get Me Gene Hackman For the past few years, Hollywood's weekend box-office tallies have come to represent a tidy bit of wisdom about American culture -- cold, bare numbers relayed around the world every Monday morning that tell us which stories and which celebrities are resonating with the moviegoing public. There is, however, another set of Hollywood statistics of enormous significance, and Tuesday is their day. How important are these numbers? Every Tuesday at lunchtime, Mike Dunn and Peter Staddon, the president and executive vice president, respectively, of 20th Century Fox's home-entertainment division, take the elevator from ther 25th-floor offices at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles down to their cars in the underground parking garage and from there drive out into the noontime traffic on their way to Best Buy, Target, Costco and Wal-Mart. Tuesday is the day new DVD's are released, the day Dunn gets a sense of whether the discs that his team has worked on for months -- or sometimes years -- will sell as well as planned. So the Fox executives wander the aisles of the big retailers. They eavesdrop. They size up the clientele. They take note of what's moving through the cash registers. Tuesday, not Monday, is their day of reckoning. And in many ways, the same is true for their parent company as well. From about 2002 on, the larger stakes in Hollywood -- the revenue that enables studios to finance blockbusters and to pay Brad Pitt and to keep the lights on -- have come to ride mostly on those little silver discs that go on sale four or five months after a theatrical release. This year, for instance, 63 percent of studio feature-film revenues in the United States will come from movies sold to retail stores; actual box office will generate only 21 percent.
