If your Internet service provider uses a POP3 mail system, however, you do need to keep the Outlook program open until the messages are actually sent off. When you have finished writing the message you want to delay, select the Options tab. In the More Options area in the Outlook toolbar ribbon, click on the Delay Delivery icon. When the Message Options box appears, go to the Delivery Options area and put a check in the box next to ''Do not deliver before.'' Select the time and date you want the message to leave.

A hyperactive former Eagle Scout, Allen will have been up for hours, if he ever went to bed. Whether or not he did is one of the many little mysteries that surround him. The abiding certainty about Allen is that sometime between 5:30 and 8:30 a.m., seven days a week, he hits ''send'' on a mass e-mail newsletter that some of America's most influential people will read before they say a word to their spouses. Allen's e-mail tipsheet, Playbook, has become the principal early-morning document for an elite set of political and news-media thrivers and strivers. Playbook is an insider's hodgepodge of predawn news, talking-point previews, scooplets, birthday greetings to people you've never heard of, random sightings (''spotted'') around town and inside jokes.

It would restrain 15 named individuals from a variety of activities, including weapons possession, trespassing and witness intimidation. It would also keep suspected gang members from associating with one another in a 100-block swath of the city and impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In other Bay Area cities, like Fairfield, civil liberties groups have attacked such injunctions as violations of constitutional rights. In Oakland, opponents argue that an injunction would do little to curb crime and much to prompt racial profiling. A report in The Bay Citizen said that a series of at least four killings put law enforcement's focus on the north Oakland group. [The Oakland Tribune, The New York Times, The Bay Citizen]Proposition Billed as Antidote to Polarization | Proposition 14, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is gaining traction. The initiative would replace traditional primaries in state and Congressional elections with twofold elections. All candidates would run in the first round. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof, would face each other in the general election. Voters' ultimate choice could be two Republicans or two Democrats, but it is likely that they would be the best-known or the wealthiest of the original field. Supporters say the measure would empower moderates and increase turnout. The state's $19 billion deficit, high unemployment and low morale may help the measure's chances; polls show a majority of voters favor it.

The history of business, they pointed out, was in large part a history of Davids knocking off Goliaths, as Microsoft did to I.B.M., Wal-Mart did to Sears and Toyota did to Detroit. Their new theory added a twist. Not only was size overrated, but the combination of two companies that sold similar products -- then in vogue -- was overrated, too.
