Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. [C1.] DO-IT-YOURSELF SEARCH ENGINE -- The voluntary collaborative ''wiki'' model, which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is being recruited to build a better search engine. [C5.] STRUGGLES FOR SATELLITE RADIO -- Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map.

Now, the two companies may be considering an attempt to merge. [C1.] WHO RUNS THE MOUSE'S WEB SITE? -- Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, is expected to unveil next week the new Disney.com Web site, which has taken more than a year to redesign. Revamping Disney.com has been a top priority as Mr. Iger seeks to extend the Disney brand by embracing new digital media. But he may be facing an equally pressing issue: Who within Disney should be running the company's Internet properties? [C1.] PUTNAM INVESTMENTS TO BE SOLD -- Marsh & McLennan Companies, the big New York insurance broker, is planning to sell its troubled mutual fund business, Putnam Investments, to a Canadian company, the Power Corporation of Canada for about $3.9 billion. [C2.] FUROR OVER A WHEAT BOARD -- Plans by the Canadian government to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country's wheat and barley exports have provoked a fight that is pitting farmer against farmer and the agency against the government. [C3.] SHOPLIFTERS' MUST-HAVE LIST -- Meat and analgesics were the items most likely to be shoplifted in 2005, bumping cosmetics and health care products down to No. 3, according to a report on supermarket theft recently issued by a trade group. [C3.] READING ON THE BOUNDING MAIN -- Book It to Bermuda, a five-day literary-themed cruise out of Boston, is the latest example of a growing genre of cruises that could be called Ship Lit. Often sponsored by publishers, the cruises, aboard commercial liners, feature popular authors who give readings and seminars -- even knitting lessons -- to boatfuls of book lovers. [C4.] BEST-LAID PLANS GO AWRY -- The Wall Street Journal is introducing its new design -- and smaller size -- tomorrow. But Wall Street is shutting down for the day in official mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford, a tradition dating from the burial of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885. [C4.] DEADLY YEAR FOR NEWS MEDIA -- The year 2006 was the deadliest for journalists and media workers worldwide, with at least 155 killings and unexplained deaths, the International Federation of Journalists announced. Another group, Reporters Without Borders, using more restrictive criteria, counted 81 journalists and 32 media assistants killed, the most since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. [C4.] GIFT LAPTOPS STIR CRITICISM -- In an effort to reach out to bloggers, Microsoft recently gave away some expensive laptops loaded with a new software system. But the gifts generated more controversy than good will: many bloggers accused the company of bribery and the bloggers who received them of unethical behavior. [C4.] DIGITAL SCRAPBOOKS, FOR A FEE -- Smilebox.com, a start-up based in Redmond, Wash., is offering its customers the opportunity to build online scrapbooks with animation, music and artwork. And in a market cluttered with free services that have struggled to produce profits, Smilebox is actually attracting paying customers, according to its chief executive, Andrew Wright, above.

A1 The list of American military fatalities in Iraq has reached the milestone of 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion. The number reflects how much more dangerous a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at a high, according to the Pentagon. A1 Confronted with a second, unofficial, and more graphic video account of the execution of Saddam Hussein, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air to augment the first pictures of the execution.

A1 River Restoration Effort In one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a nearly century-long dry spell. That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles to Los Angeles. A1 Overcrowding in Madison Madison, Wis., a college town that sought to reverse the decline of its downtown in the 1980s and 90s to draw people at night and on weekends, is now facing overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime.

But the car companies have found it more difficult than ever to keep a lid on their closely guarded designs, forcing them to rethink how they disseminate early information. [C3.] RECORD SALES AT VOLKWAGEN -- Group vehicle sales at Volkwagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, advanced 9.3 percent in 2006, to a record 5.73 million units, thanks to brisk growth around the world and across its brands. [C3.] CONVERGENCE IN THE CELLPHONE -- The world of desktop computing is finally going mobile, and the shift can be seen in the explosive growth of wireless data for cellular carriers. The newest screen is adopting more and more characteristics of a personal computer. And many believe that the next big shift will be the convergence of many forms of communication encompassing voice, e-mail, instant messaging and video telephony. [C1.] HIRING FOR ONLINE COVERAGE -- The offices of The Politico, the (mostly) online news venture starting publication in two weeks, looks like a standard newsroom -- reporters tap on computers at adjacent desks while banks of televisions hum overhead. But unlike a standard daily newspaper, The Politico will be devoted to a single topic: national politics. Another big difference: It is hiring. [C1.] WHILE BUREAUS SHRINK -- Faced with declining advertising and competition from the Web, midsize regional dailies across the country have been retrenching in recent years, scaling back their Washington coverage and their national ambitions. [C8.] A MICROSOFT VENTURE WITH FORD -- For Bill Gates, left, the chairman of Microsoft, the Consumer Electronics Show has become an annual forum to mix product announcements with computer-filled visions of future Microsoft-based technologies. This year he is unveiling a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to build Microsoft technology into several Ford models. [C5.] EARLY LOOK AT VIDEO GAME BATTLES -- The most widely watched report on holiday video game sales is not out until Thursday, but early hints suggest that it may hold a few surprises. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, makers have announced that they are shipping more consoles and selling more games than expected, providing an early look at what may be a multiyear battle among Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. [C4.] TAKE-ALONG SATELLITE DISH -- Rick Rosner, the creator and producer of numerous television series, likes to surround himself with television -- so much so that he invented a portable satellite dish that folds up like a piece of luggage and can be toted on camping trips or to tailgate parties. [C1.] FRESHENING UP OLD SPICE -- Can an agency known for offbeat campaigns that appeal to younger men, for brands like Nike, ESPN and Miller High Life, freshen the stodgy image of the Old Spice line of men's grooming products? [C6.] IRAQ CONFIRMS A SOURCE EXISTS -- After weathering six weeks of criticism for quoting an Iraqi police captain whose existence had been called into question, The Associated Press won a vindication last week when Iraq changed its story and acknowledged that, yes, Jamil Hussein does work there. [C8.] FRANK AND FRANK ON WEALTH -- Robert Frank, a reporter who covers private wealth for The Wall Street Journal, and Robert H. Frank, an economist and professor at Cornell University (who also contributes to The New York Times), have both written books dealing with the culture of wealth in the United States. [C8.] A TWO-HANKY, JUMBO TUB MOVIE -- People watching ''Love Story,'' the lachrymose 1970 romance, ate on average 28 percent more buttered, salted popcorn than those watching ''Sweet Home Alabama,'' a 2002 comedy, according to a survey described in The Journal of Marketing. [C3.] CHINA HINTS AT FLEXIBILITY -- China may increase the flexibility of the yuan if its trade surplus continues to expand this year, China's central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said a meeting of central bank governors from the Group of 10 nations. [C2.] BRITAIN, TOO, LOVES DVR -- British Sky Broadcasting's sale of more than two million digital video recorders showed the international appeal of a technology that wrests control of television schedules out of the hands of broadcasters and into the homes of viewers.

The drug maker says it will discuss its ''strategic direction,'' which Wall Street analysts widely expect will include a goodly number of job cuts. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to reduce costs, and Pfizer said in November that it was laying off a fifth of its United States sales force. Mr. Kindler has called for Pfizer to become more entrepreneurial. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE -- President Bush will give the State of the Union address on Tuesday. He is expected to announce a tax plan aimed at making health insurance more affordable for low-income people and to discuss energy initiatives to help reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

[C7.] TROUBLE WITH ANEMIA DRUG -- Amgen, the biotechnology company, said that its anemia drug Aranesp increased the risk of death when used to treat certain cancer patients, a finding that will probably raise more questions about it and very similar drugs. [C3.] MICROSOFT REPORTS SALES -- Microsoft reported strong sales for its latest quarter and a profit that slightly surpassed Wall Street estimates, but its financial results were muddled by the late arrival of important new products. [C1.] 12 PERCENT ARE UNION WORKERS -- Union membership dropped sharply last year in the United States, falling by 326,000 to 15.4 million workers. The percentage of employees in unions is now 12 percent, down from 35 percent in the 1950s. [A17.] PROTEST FOLLOWS RAID -- An immigration raid at a huge North Carolina pork-packing plant provoked protests from union officials, who charged that the company, Smithfield Foods, had collaborated with the authorities searching for illegal immigrants to discourage its workers from organizing.

[C3.] AT&T PROFIT UP 17 PERCENT -- AT&T reported a 17 percent increase in quarterly profits driven by a sizable increase in wireless subscribers.

Investors have been hoping that rates would be lowered, but positive economic reports last week about new home sales and big factory orders have made that less likely. On Friday, the government is expected to report on unemployment for December, with forecasters predicting an increase of 140,000 jobs. VISTA FOR THE HOME PC -- Microsoft plans to introduce its Vista operating system to consumers on Tuesday after a two-year delay in getting the much-anticipated product to the market. Some computer stores will stay open past midnight Monday so that eager customers can get their copies right away. PRELIMINARY G.D.P. NUMBERS -- This week will bring the first look at the fourth-quarter gross domestic product (Wednesday). Other economic reports include the Conference Board's look at consumer confidence (Tuesday); the Chicago purchasing managers' index for January and construction spending for December (Wednesday); and personal income and spending for December and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for January (Thursday). AUTO SALES -- On Thursday, automakers are scheduled to report sales for January. Given last week's crushing news that 2006 had been the worst year in the history of the Ford Motor Company -- and that Toyota keeps narrowing the gap between itself and General Motors as the world's largest automaker -- the report is likely to receive much scrutiny.

Now in prison, where he's serving a life sentence, Mr. Hanssen was a little of each; he was also greedy, pathetic, malevolent -- a creep's creep.

No kidding. For many of the 25 years he worked at the F.B.I., he covertly thrived in that culture, like a stealth malignancy.

(The Star costs $1.)

But thousands of smaller used- and rare-book merchants, like Rob Stuart, above, owner of Frenchboro Books in Maine, say they will suffer, because they rely on foreign demand.

But it wasn't. The MySpace page was a plant, concocted by the producers of the CBS sitcom ''How I Met Your Mother,'' to play off a storyline in the show's Nov. 20 episode. [C8.] EXCLUSIVE TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE -- Samuel Zell, who has agreed to buy the Tribune Company, gave his first interview exclusively to The Chicago Tribune.

''It is important to not only know the laws, but the road culture before you go,'' she said. Traffic accidents are the leading cause of nonnatural death for Americans overseas, according to the State Department. [C7.] SALLIE MAE SOLD TO PRIVATE FIRMS -- Sallie Mae agreed to be sold for $25 billion to two private equity investors amid calls in Washington to cut federal subsidies for student loans.

Rupert Murdoch usually gets what he wants, but he may need some of his trademark patience to convince the board of Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, to accept his $5 billion offer to buy the company. [Page A1.] The Dow Jones board said that it would take no action on the bid by Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, but it did not reject the offer, leaving him some wiggle room. [C1.] A deal for Dow Jones could allow thousands of its employees to cash out their stock options for a tidy profit. [C4.] Already, some investors, perhaps acting on insider information, have made a bundle by purchasing options in recent weeks speculating that Dow Jones shares would rise. [C4.] SECRET CODE IS NOW JUST A CODE -- A throng of tech-savvy Internet users have banded together over the last two days to publish and widely distribute a secret code used by the technology and movie industries to prevent piracy of high-definition movies. [A1.] FOOD IMPORT LABELED INCORRECTLY -- A Chinese company accused of selling contaminated wheat gluten to American pet food suppliers avoided inspections partly because it did not correctly disclose its shipping contents to Chinese export authorities, according to American regulators. [C1.] CHOPPED LIVER, THINKING AHEAD -- Zingerman's, in Ann Arbor, Mich., is both a beloved local deli and $30 million enterprise with a gourmet catalog and nationwide mail-order business. Its owners attribute the growth to a rare commodity in the food business -- planning ahead. [C1.] I.R.S. CURTAILS OFFSHORE AUDITS -- The Internal Revenue Service is curtailing audits of many people who use offshore tax havens because agents fear they cannot meet a three-year deadline for finishing an examination. [C1.] DON'T SKIP THIS COMMERCIAL -- How do you create a campaign for TiVo, the digital video recording device that helps people avoid advertisements? TiVo has hired an agency known for broad humor, and it has created commercials inspired by the ''TiVo Man,'' the cartoon character with an antenna on his head. Look for movie critic Gene Shalit, above, and others sporting antennas. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.] VYING FOR ABN AMRO -- The fight for control of ABN Amro, the largest Dutch bank, brings head to head the chiefs of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, two very different individuals. [C13.] MAKINGS OF A POSSIBLE DEAL -- The Dolan family's $10.6 billion bid to buy Cablevision Systems, the company they founded, was the result of persistence and a private meeting with the two board members who had rejected previous buyout offers from the family. [C3.] MAGNA IN TALKS WITH AUTO UNIONS -- The Canadian auto parts maker Magna International, which is considering a bid for Chrysler, is in talks with Canadian and American auto unions about adding Magna's workers to their ranks. [C13.] SHRINKING NOTEBOOKS -- Ultraportable notebook computers -- supercompact, lightweight laptops that slip into briefcases as easily as a legal pad -- have made the jump from Europe and appear to be finding favor with American tastes. [C11.] LESS ENERGY, MORE SPEED -- Scientists at I.B.M. are reporting an advance in chip making that could increase the speed of semiconductors and reduce their energy consumption. [C3.] TIME WARNER RIDES CABLE EARNINGS -- Time Warner, the world's largest media company, raised its 2007 forecast after surging cable television earnings helped first-quarter profit beat analysts' estimates. Net income declined 18 percent, and sales rose 9.2 percent. Profit was dragged down by a 27 percent decline at the film division, which failed to produce a hit to beat last year's ''Harry Potter'' DVD release. [C3.] SPRINT REPORTS QUARTERLY LOSS -- The Sprint Nextel Corporation, the wireless carrier, reported a quarterly loss, fueling concern that the company was losing market share to its rivals. [C2.] ANOTHER NEW HIGH FOR THE DOW -- Shares jumped again on Wall Street, and the Dow Jones industrials past 13,200 for the first time after a strong reading on factory orders helped spur investor optimism. [C15.] WOLFOWITZ'S CONDUCT -- The World Bank committee investigating the conduct of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the bank president, are leaning toward finding that he violated the institution's rules against conflicts of interest when he arranged a pay raise and promotion for his companion, bank officials said. [A6.] WARNINGS ON SUICIDE -- The Food and Drug Administration ordered drug makers to add warnings to antidepressant medications, saying the drugs increase the risk of suicidal behavior in some young adults. [A17.] AHOLD SELLS U.S. FOODSERVICE -- The Netherlands-based grocery store operator Royal Ahold said that it had agreed to sell the distributor U.S. Foodservice to private equity firms for $7.1 billion.

Companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo find themselves going after the same candidates or recruiting in one another's backyards. At the same time, they are running up against a myriad of start-up companies across Silicon Valley. To lure talent, these companies have expanded their recruiting arsenal far beyond the traditional job fair to include events like technology lectures, cocktail parties, pizza parties, treasure hunts and programming contests, called ''code jams'' or ''hack days.'' [Page C1.] LOOKING FOR STARS Despite being the first and certainly the largest African-American cable channel, Black Entertainment Television has developed few of its own marketable stars and virtually no breakout programs. It relies on reruns, movies and music videos for the bulk of its lineup. The chief executive of BET, Debra L. Lee, has tried to reverse that trend, this year increasing the channel's production budget 50 percent and plunging into original programming with 16 new shows for the fall. [C1.] POLICEMAN, NOT A REPORTER David Cunningham, a prominent protester who heads the Anti-Poverty Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia, recently received a call from someone who said he was a reporter named Peter MacKay from the free daily tabloid 24 Hours Vancouver. But when Mr. Cunningham arrived outside a shopping mall for what he thought would be an interview, Peter MacKay turned out to be a plainclothes police officer who arrested him. Someone in the Vancouver Police Department thought the deception was a clever way to lure Mr. Cunningham, but the ruse provoked widespread criticism from civil rights and journalism groups. [C4.] HIGH ASPIRATIONS Though far from a household name in telecommunications, Altimo, the Russian telecommunications investment company, has aspirations of becoming a global power. But the problem it faces, some analysts say, is that at this point, Altimo has made few allies. If it is known beyond Russia at all, it is for its propensity to fight tenaciously in court and on corporate boards for its ambitions, some say. [C5.] THE MALE DIETER The face of dieting may be changing. Of the 72 million people dieting in the United States, 38 percent -- about 28 million -- are men, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a market research company. It estimates that the diet industry will be $58.7 billion this year. And NutriSystem has hired its first male spokesman, the former quarterback Dan Marino, and has started advertising in Sports Illustrated, Men's Health and ESPN magazine. [C3.] MAINSTREAM PROMOTION Mel Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' demonstrated to Hollywood just how many evangelical moviegoers there are and how much money can be made from them. Mindful of that market, Universal Pictures has teamed up with Grace Hill Media, a public relations firm that reaches out to religious groups, to publicize the mainstream film ''Evan Almighty.'' Scheduled for wide release on June 22, it stars Steve Carell as a politician who abandons Congress in order to build an ark, taking off on the story of Noah. [C3.] TALLYING GLIMPSES When the sleek yacht of the Luna Rossa team sailed away with a victory in the America's Cup semifinals, there were two vital results. The Italian crew eliminated the American team of BMW Oracle Racing with a 33-second lead. And fleeting glimpses of the flapping mainsails -- branded with logos of Telecom Italia Mobile and the broadband service Alice -- reached millions of television viewers. Those glimpses are now being counted down to the second, categorized by clear and partial visibility, tallied by major countries and then compared with the cost of traditional spot advertisements. [C2.] WEB PROPERTY DEVELOPER NameMedia, a privately held owner and developer of Web sites based in Waltham, Mass., is best seen as an online property developer, its chief executive, Kelly P. Conlin, said. Analysts suggest that NameMedia and its competitors could represent the next wave of Internet initial public offerings, while also providing a peek at a significant change in what people see when they stumble onto obscure Web properties. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. [C5.] THE TOUCH-UP In a situation not as emotionally charged as when Time magazine darkened O.J. Simpson's mug shot on its cover a decade ago, no fewer than three magazines were reacting to claims last week that they had doctored their covers -- and one retouched celebrity even cried foul. [C4.] A PULITZER AWARD Often the writing and photography that win Pulitzer Prizes require heroic efforts. For one recipient, Jahangir Razmi , the process of receiving the award also took 27 years. In 1979, Mr. Razmi stood near executioners as they shot Kurdish prisoners in Sanandaj, Iran. One picture was picked up by the wire service United Press International. To protect Mr. Razmi, his name was never printed. But after decades of keeping silent, Mr. Razmi allowed his name to appear in a December 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, which prompted the Pulitzer Prize Board to seek out Mr. Razmi to award him the prize in person. [C4.] VIEWER REVOLT The cancellation of the CBS series ''Jericho'' has led to a viewer revolt that has included not only the usual petition drives, but also the delivery of tons of nuts (mostly walnuts, but also peanuts and pecans) to the two responsible CBS executives. [C4.] THE PRETEEN MARKET With a faithful audience in the millions, magazines for the early teenage years are in overdrive, bolstered by last year's enthusiasm for new stars from the Disney Channel's hit ''High School Musical,'' which made household names not only of Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu, but also of Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne Hudgens.

Behind the News -- The world's highest mountain, at 29,028 feet, has also been called the world's highest garbage dump. Over the years, would-be summiteers have left behind tons of trash -- tents, oxygen bottles, pots, stoves and other junk, not to mention the corpses of dozens of climbers. The Japanese climber Ken Noguchi says his teams have hauled 19,800 pounds of garbage in five trips since 2000. This year, he says, ''the amount of waste left on the mountain has been drastically decreased.'' SPACE DEBRIS The News -- Two Russian cosmonauts erected protection panels on the International Space Station to shield it from space debris. Behind the News -- The cosmonauts spent about five and a half hours outside setting up the protective panels. Scientists consider space debris, which includes discarded rocket parts and small rocks, to be the biggest threat to the space station, which orbits 220 miles above Earth. NASA says about 11,000 human-created objects larger than 10 centimeters -- about 4 inches -- are in orbit, plus another 100,000 particles between a centimeter and 10 centimeters in size. CALL IN THE BULLDOZERS The News -- Officials in India said Wednesday they are seeking developers to demolish the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital. Behind the News -- The slum's tin shanties and garbage-strewn alleys lie on prime land in the heart of the city. Perhaps one million people live in Dharavi, but the city counts just 56,000 families. The United Nations estimates there is 1 toilet per 1,440 people. Mumbai wants to build new housing, shopping, schools and hospitals as part of a $2.3 billion project. Residents will be offered free 225-square-foot apartments, but some say they fear they will end up with nothing. SPAMALOT NO MORE The News -- Federal authorities in Seattle arrested a man they say is one of the world's most prolific e-mail spammers. Behind the News -- Robert Alan Soloway, 27, was accused of using networks of compromised computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. Mr. Soloway advertised that he could send out 20 million e-mails over 15 days for $495, according to the federal indictment. He pleaded not guilty to charges of mail, wire and e-mail fraud and other crimes. ''He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world,'' said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft lawyer. ''He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day.'' NO WHERE LEFT TO GO The News -- Tons of garbage piled up on the streets of Naples, Italy, after the only working dump in the area closed. Behind the News -- Italy's president warned of an ''ecological and health disaster'' in the country's third-largest city. The city's neighborhoods have resisted efforts to build incinerators, recycling centers and new trash sites as existing dumps filled up. One nearby town has opened its dump for 20 days to take some trash, but after that, who knows? Many residents are burning their refuse or leaving it to rot.

Mark Twain was an early enthusiast of the typewriter, and his ''Life on the Mississippi'' is believed to be the first typewritten literary manuscript. ''The machine has several virtues,'' he remarked of his Remington. ''I believe it will print faster than I can write.'' Today, most novelists don't venture beyond the word processor -- and many still write longhand. But others are finding that sophisticated software is invaluable to the literary enterprise. While Dickens and George Eliot had only notebooks and their wits to keep their Victorian triple-deckers in order, novelists like Richard Powers, Vikram Chandra and Marisha Pessl have used everything from Excel spreadsheets to logistics programs like Microsoft Project to organize their imaginative universes. To them, computer technology isn't a threat to literature but an essential tool. ''As life becomes increasingly complex, the kind of novel that tries to link the individual life with broad-canvas collective existence becomes more difficult to coordinate,'' Powers wrote in an e-mail message -- or rather, dictated, since he uses the voice recognition software built into the Tablet PC operating system to compose everything, including his novels.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS) BANK FACES TRIAL IN ITALY A judge in Milan has ordered Bank of America to stand trial on market-rigging charges arising from the multibillion-dollar collapse of the food conglomerate Parmalat in 2003. The judge, Cesare Tacconi, indicted the bank and scheduled the trial to start Jan. 23. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., said the charges were not criminal but ''purely administrative in nature'' and ''completely unfounded.'' In June, four other banks -- Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley -- were ordered to face trial in Milan on charges that they failed to take steps that might have prevented Parmalat's failure. In market rigging, false information is given to the market to influence prices.

Cayne, sold $15.4 million of the company's stock this month, at the end of a year in which he found himself at the forefront of a global credit crisis. Mr. Cayne exercised and sold 172,621 shares of stock vested under a capital accumulation plan on Dec. 21, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was paid $89.01 a share, according to the filing. The stock he sold was acquired in 2002 through a grant of units that were converted into stock this year. A spokeswoman for the company said executives who acquire such shares typically sell them for tax purposes. (AP) ALLERGY DRUG IS APPROVED Mylan said its Mylan Pharmaceuticals unit received final approval from health regulators in the United States for its generic version of Pfizer's allergy drug Zyrtec. The approval is for cetirizine hydrochloride tablets, 5 mg and 10 mg, and the tablets will be shipped immediately, the company said. Zyrtec had sales in the United States of about $1.4 billion for the 12 months ended Sept. 30. (REUTERS) DEAL IN PATENT DISPUTE The Vonage Holdings Corporation, a provider of Internet phone service, said it had agreed to pay AT&T up to $7.8 million a year to settle a patent dispute. Vonage said as part of the settlement, it agreed to make a payment of $1.95 million to AT&T in January and then pay $650,000 per month over the life of the five-year contract. In addition, Vonage said AT&T had granted it non-exclusive rights to AT&T patents related to voice-over-Internet protocol and dual-mode wireless services.

''A formal announcement will be distributed when appropriate,'' Nasdaq said.
