Pacing the room, I craved an extra hand: one to hold the book, another to turn its pages, a third to underline. In earlier eras, I wouldn't have minded. The Romans needed no table to rest their scrolls on; in an age when adults read aloud, standing allowed the voice to project. Doctors in antiquity recommended reading as a healthy exercise for body and mind: a speaker holding a scroll expanded his lungs, strengthened his arms and stretched his back. Early in the first millennium, however, as the unfurled scroll gave way to the folded and gathered codex that we know today, readers began to fold at the waist as well. Those who had stood now sat; those who had sat now reclined. By the 18th century, the rise of safer candles and smaller trim sizes let readers take books to bed. Previously almost as large as a mainframe, treasonous tracts and pornographic illustrations alike could now be slipped into a pocket.

Temporarily defeated, they popped in a DVD of ''I, Robot.'' There's a scene in the movie when Will Smith, who plays a robot-hating cop, visits Bridget Moynahan, the impossibly gorgeous scientist, and they begin to argue. She gets angry. Her personal robot immediately walks into the room and asks: ''Is everything all right, Ma'am? I detected elevated stress patterns in your voice.'' It's a minor exchange -- a computer recognizing emotion in a human voice -- in a movie full of futuristic robots wreaking havoc, but it was an aha moment for a desperate research team.

He reads English, French and Arabic, but most of the time he reads N'Ko, a language few speakers of those languages would recognize. N'Ko is the standardized writing system for Mande languages, a family of closely related tongues -- among them Traore's language of Mandinka, but also Jula, Bamana, Koyaga, Marka -- spoken, for the most part, in eight West African countries, by some 35 million people. N'Ko looks like a cross between Arabic and ancient Norse runes, written from right to left in a blocky script with the letters connected underneath. Traore types e-mail to his family on his laptop in N'Ko, works on his Web site in N'Ko, tweets in N'Ko on his iPhone and iPad and reads books and newspapers written in N'Ko to prepare for the N'Ko classes he teaches in the Bronx and for his appearances on an Internet radio program to discuss cultural issues around the use of N'Ko. For years, the Web's lingua franca was English. Speakers of French, Hindi and Urdu, Arabic, Chinese and Russian chafed at the advantage the Internet gave not only American pop culture but also its language. For those who lived at the intersection of modern technology and traditional cultures, the problem was even worse. ''For a long time, technology was the enemy,'' says In\u00e9e Slaughter, executive director of the New Mexico-based Indigenous Language Institute, which teaches Native Americans and other indigenous peoples how to use digital technologies to keep their languages vital. Heritage languages were being killed off by increasing urbanization, the spread of formal education and the shift to cash crops, which ended the isolation of indigenous communities. Advances in technology seemed to intensify the decline. ''Even in 1999 or 2000, people were saying technology killed their language,'' Slaughter says. ''Community elders worried about it. As television came into homes, English became pervasive 24/7. Mainstream culture infiltrated, and young kids want to be like that. It was a huge, huge problem, and it's still there. But now we know ways technology can be helpful.''", "headline": {"main": "Everyone Speaks Text Message", "kicker": "VENTURES"}, "abstract": "Digital technology has become a lifeline for many tiny, endangered heritage languages like N'Ko, a standardized writing system for Mande languages spoken, for the most part, in eight West African countries; cellphones are a particularly useful tool in helping to spread the use and learning of endangered languages, many of which have no written form, after they have been transliterated into the alphabets of national languages.

I was a self-taught programmer, and it was through Ritchie that I came to understand the layers of software that worked beneath the screens and printers and keyboards and mice. The newness of C's conception -- and the elegance of it -- was that the language was both ''high'' and ''low.'' Higher-level languages -- like Cobol and Fortran -- kept you out of the innards of the machine. ''Lower-level'' languages -- called ''assembler'' -- worked on only specific hardware.
