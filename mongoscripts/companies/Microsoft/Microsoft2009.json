The Democratic Party is enjoying a resurgence in Virginia, propelled first by the November victory of Barack Obama -- the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Lyndon Johnson -- and now by a lively battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. There are three men who want the nomination, but on this weekend, you could be forgiven for thinking that there was only one, and that his name was Terry McAuliffe. There were McAuliffe signs everywhere, an exhausting blur of blue and yellow starting at the airport and rolling for nine miles to the entrance of the Greater Richmond Convention Center. There, bustling McAuliffe campaign workers, rolling around on electric carts, hoisted a McAuliffe for Governor banner over the street. A marching band stepped in place, before accompanying McAuliffe and his supporters as they paraded around the center, grandly announcing his arrival. Inside, volunteers scattered the hall with 2,500 McAuliffe fortune cookies, which crumbled open to reveal fortunes like high speed rail is in your future. The fortune-cookie count came courtesy of the McAuliffe campaign, which also reported that the campaign had purchased 39 dinner tables, printed 1,000 McAuliffe for Governor signs, issued 300 glow sticks to wave at the dinner and was paying for two after-dinner parties, with open bars. It was a display of political money and muscle that was quite unlike anything anyone had ever seen at the annual dinner. ''When I decide to do something,'' McAuliffe said as he marched along with his band, ''I do it.''", "headline": {"main": "GOVERNOR CLINTONISM?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 5047, "_id": "4fd28eb78eb7c8105d86507c", "snippet": "Terry McAuliffe, power broker of the Clinton era, is trying to remake himself as a candidate in the age of Obama.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/magazine/10Mcauliffe-t.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2009/05/05/magazine/10mcauliffe-75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2009/05/05/magazine/10mcauliffe-75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2009/05/05/magazine/10mcauliffe-500.jpg", "height": 500, "width": 399, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 399, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2009/05/05/magazine/10mcauliffe-500.jpg", "xlargeheight": 500}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MCAULIFFE, TERRY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, HILLARY RODHAM"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "VIRGINIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DEMOCRATIC PARTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Adam", "lastname": "NAGOURNEY"}], "original": "By ADAM NAGOURNEY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-05-10T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine; Washington"}], "meta": {"hits": 6, "offset": 0, "time": 43}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

In this first entry the mountaineer Peter Athans leads an expedition of climbers, archaeologists, anthropologists and art historians on a mission to rescue valuable Tibetan texts from their deteriorating shelter before looters find them. A confrontation results, involving a political group from a nearby village, the king of Mustang and even the rights of the divinities that are believed to inhabit the area. In ''Lost Cave Temples of the Himalaya,'' at 9, Liesel Clark chronicles the 2007 expedition of Mr. Athans, who is her husband, and the big-wall climber Renan Ozturk as they maneuvered into the crumbling caves, where each vertical move was a step into a lost world unoccupied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. 9:45 A.M.
