Economists say they believe the aberration may -- or may not -- presage an economic slowdown. Here are some predictions for the weeks ahead: The dollar, bolstered by the prospect of another interest-rate hike, will gain a bit against the yen and the euro; the price of oil will stay above $60 as OPEC keeps a lid on supplies; gold, which shot up 18.3 percent last year, to $518.90 for February delivery, will continue its ascent; housing prices will cool; stocks will keep dillydallying; and that pesky inverted yield curve will go away. ABOUT THOSE RATE INCREASES -- Let us not forget that a few lonely prognosticators think that the Federal Reserve, under the stewardship of Alan Greenspan's successor, Ben S. Bernanke, above, will surprise everybody (except them) by holding interest rates steady at the Fed's next meeting. With that in mind, soothsayers of all stripes will be studying the minutes of the central bank's Dec. 13 policy-setting meeting, which will be made public tomorrow. THE BIGGEST SHOW ON EARTH -- The International Consumer Electronics Show opens Thursday in Las Vegas, and Bill Gates of Microsoft will start off the five-day event the night before with a speech on what he thinks lies ahead for consumer electronics. The show, the world's biggest technology trade exhibit, will occupy space equivalent to 28 football fields, according to The Associated Press. Participants will range from industry giants like Intel, which will unveil a new generation of multimedia platforms and chips, to mom-and-pop companies eager to display their wares. One event that is being trumpeted on the Web site of the Consumer Electronics Association, the extravaganza's sponsor, is not to be missed. In a ''Fatal1ty Ultimate Gaming Shootout,'' Johnathan Wendel, the five-time world champion PC gamer known as Fatal1ty, will test the gaming skills of participants. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS -- Economists expect the payroll report on Friday to show that 200,000 jobs were created last month, adding to the 3.5 million new hires of the last 17 months. They also think the unemployment rate will either remain at 5 percent or slip to 4.9 percent. Construction spending figures for November (expected to rise 0.6 percent) and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index (expected to fall to 57.1, from 58.1), will be released tomorrow. Factory orders for November (expected to rise 0.8 percent) and store sales for the last week of December will come out on Wednesday.

D1 ARTS E1-8 Unmasking a Reclusive Novelist JT Leroy, a novelist who has published three critically acclaimed books, was believed to be a shy and reclusive young man who appeared in public often disguised beneath a wig and glasses. It has now been revealed, however, that the public role of ''JT Leroy'' is played by a young woman. Still unsettled is the question of who writes under that name. E1 Documentaries Address Terror The American directors of two documentaries being shown at Film Forum in New York this month address Peru's struggle against the Shining Path insurgent organization. While neither film explicitly draws parallels with the American war on terror, the issues raised -- from antiterrorist tactics to civil liberties -- have a familiar ring.

Otellini, introduced Apple's first Macintosh computers that use processing chips from Intel. Behind the News -- The shift came several months ahead of schedule, and surprised analysts. It was only last spring that Apple said it would stop using I.B.M. processors, a decision that shook up the semiconductor industry. The move to Intel chips was also something of a shock, since Intel has long been an ally of Apple's rival, Microsoft. CHANGE OF AIR The News -- After more than two decades on terrestrial radio, the shock jock Howard Stern began broadcasting by satellite. Behind the News -- The switch is a gamble for Sirius Satellite Radio, which is paying Mr. Stern hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of attracting more listeners willing to pay a monthly subscription fee. It's also something of a gamble for Mr. Stern, who earned his bad-boy reputation by pushing up against Federal Communications Commission standards on indecency. The new show featured plenty of foul language since, as a satellite show, it falls outside the F.C.C.'s purview. He no longer has the agency to kick around. FACE CHANGE The News -- The United States Mint introduced a new version of the nickel, with the portrait of Thomas Jefferson facing front. Behind the News -- The Treasury has been making a lot of changes lately, particularly in paper money, emphasizing new anticounterfeiting technologies. The changes to the nickel have little to do with technology but may upset purists just the same. In the 97 years that presidents have been stamped on coins, never has one been shown in anything other than profile. Purists had better get used to the new look, however: no further changes to the nickel are in the works. CHANGING SCENERY The News -- Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who shot Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square in 1981, was released from prison in Istanbul. Behind the News -- The release was strongly criticized by Turkey's justice minister, who said it offended the ''public conscience'' and ordered a review. Mr. Agca, 48, had been convicted not only of shooting the pope but of killing a Turkish journalist. He will remain free while the appeal is heard. But he is also obligated to fulfill his mandatory military service, which he missed while in prison. CHANGE OF HEART The News -- The skier Bode Miller apologized for statements he made that suggested he had raced while under the influence of alcohol. Behind the News -- Miller, the best all-around skier the United States has ever produced, had been under pressure from American and international ski officials to apologize after his remarks on ''60 Minutes.'' While he apologized, he neither admitted nor denied that he had raced after drinking, and he spoke for little more than two minutes without taking questions.

The week's biggest offering is likely to be the one from Resource Capital, a real estate investment trust that is also set to make its debut on Wednesday.

[A1.] Fourth-Quarter Sales Drop at Bristol-Myers Bristol-Myers Squibb has become the latest drug maker to post lower revenue, announcing a fourth-quarter sales decline of nearly 3 percent, to $5.02 billion, as competition increased for the cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, its second-biggest seller. The company said net income for the fourth quarter more than tripled to $499 million, or 26 cents a share, but that was largely because of lower tax costs. As uncertainties seemed to mount, Bristol-Myers predicted lower sales and earnings for 2006, with generic competition and patent losses weighing down sales. [C3.] Google Case May Not Center on Privacy The Justice Department's move to try to force Google to turn over a week's worth of searches has set off concerns over privacy.

It will turn, instead, on serious but relatively routine questions about trade secrets and civil procedure.

Ovitz, left, a dismissal that cost the company $140 million in severance pay.

The results give Hamas the right to form the next government, ending more than 40 years of domination by Fatah. A1 Hamas's victory threw President Bush and his aides on the defensive, complicating the administration's policy of trying to promote democracy as an antidote to the spread of terrorism in the Arab world. Mr. Bush said the results spoke to the failures of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to root out corruption, not to any flaws in the Bush administration's policy. A11 The elections were met with a mixture of jubilation and consternation in much of the Arab world, and for some it raised the concern that, in winning, Hamas would almost certainly have to change. A11 European leaders, whose countries are major financial donors to the Palestinian Authority, registered disquiet verging on hostility toward Hamas's triumph.

A8 More Energy Woes for Georgia Energy shortages struck Georgia anew as a wind storm toppled a major power transmission line and Russia's gas monopoly failed to restore the flow of natural gas to the country after pipelines were sabotaged last weekend, energy officials said. A4 Groups Protest U.N. Proposal Human rights organizations and the Congressional Human Rights Caucus protested a decision by the United States to back a measure introduced by Iran denying two international gay rights groups a voice at the United Nations. A4 NATIONAL A14-21 Poll Finds Mixed Support For Domestic Spy Program Americans are willing to tolerate eavesdropping without warrants to fight terrorism, but are concerned that the aggressive antiterrorism programs championed by the Bush administration are encroaching on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. A1 President Bush declared again that his administration's program for eavesdropping without warrants was well within existing law, and said efforts in Congress to write legislation expressly giving him authority for such a program were unnecessary and dangerous.

He had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possession of drugs after the police said they found him with heroin and cocaine, among other drugs. Mr. Doherty, 26, right, the lead singer of Babyshambles and former boyfriend of the model Kate Moss, appeared disoriented during the hearing and spoke only to confirm his name and address, but his lawyer, Sean Curran, argued against imprisonment. ''He's only a harm to himself, and the real shame here would be if he did not receive the treatment he needs,'' Mr. Curran said. Mr. Doherty's fans, in the gallery of the Ealing Magistrates' Court, burst into applause when it became clear that he would not be jailed. Judge Ann McLaughlin warned him that he if he did not heed the rehabilitation order, he could be jailed. The maximum term for possession of heroin and cocaine is seven years. Warren E. Buffett Turns Toon Warren E. Buffett is listed by Forbes.com as second in wealth only to Bill Gates of Microsoft. When Mr. Buffett, left, auctioned off a lunch date for charity last year on eBay, the chance to hear advice from the sage billionaire, who runs the Nebraska-based investment titan Berkshire Hathaway, brought a bid of $350,000. Soon, however, children everywhere will have the chance to amass financial wisdom from a cartoon version of the man known as the Oracle of Omaha, Reuters reported yesterday. Mr. Buffett is going to star in ''The Secret Millionaire's Club,'' a DVD series for children 5 to 12. Produced by DIC Entertainment, with headquarters in Burbank, Calif., and shares listed in London, the 13-title series, featuring the words, voice and likeness of Mr. Buffett, tells of an unscrupulous developer accumulating properties in Omaha and foreclosing on the local youth center. Four children raise money to rescue the center and turn to Mr. Buffett for weekly financial and investment advice. The first two titles are to be released in the fall. Financial terms of DIC's deal with Mr. Buffett were not disclosed. Footnote ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' an original new musical comedy that began life as a bachelor party skit, will make its Broadway debut on April 3 at the Marquis Theater, to be vacated on Feb. 19 by ''The Woman in White.'' ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' with the Tony Award winner Sutton Foster (''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') as one of its stars, went from skit to hit of the 1999 Toronto Fringe Festival to acclaim at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles. With a cast of 17, it tells the story of a musical- theater addict who drops the needle on his favorite LP, a 1928 musical comedy ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' and sees its story -- of a pampered starlet about to be married and the producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials -- come to life.

[Page C1.] White House Explains Decision on Ports Review The Bush administration decided last month that a politically explosive deal to hand over operations at major American ports to a government-owned company in Dubai did not involve national security and so did not require a more lengthy review, administration officials said. [A1.] In the political collision between the White House and Congress over the $6.8 billion deal that would give a Dubai company management of six American ports, most experts seem to agree on only one major point: The gaping holes in security at American ports have little to do with the nationality of who is running them.

The pipeline would move 4.5 to 6 billion cubic feet of gas daily and begin operating between 2012 to 2014. Alaska has an estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. But significant political, environmental and regulatory hurdles must still be overcome before construction can begin. News Analysis.

Market Place. [Page C1.] Auto Industry Seeks to Find Best Buyout Strategy Creating the perfect departure package is a crucial element in enticing workers off the payrolls at both General Motors and Delphi, which are negotiating with the United Automobile Workers over the future of thousands of autoworkers at both companies. News Analysis. [C1.] Microsoft's New Operating System to Be Delayed Microsoft's effort to deliver the next version of its Windows operating system suffered another setback when the company said that the system would not be ready for consumer personal computers for the holiday sales season. The Microsoft announcement, made after the close of the stock market, came as a surprise. For more than a year, the company had said it would deliver the new operating system, Windows Vista, sometime in the second half of 2006. Analysts said the delay would be a disappointment for electronics store chains, like Circuit City and Best Buy, and for PC makers. [C1.] Drug Makers Have Tentative Deal in Patent Case Sanofi-Aventis and its partner Bristol-Myers Squibb said that they had tentatively settled a patent dispute involving Plavix, the anti-clotting agent that is the world's second-best-selling drug. [C4.] Inquiry Begun by Guidant May Aid Those Suing It The Guidant Corporation may have gotten more than it bargained for last year when it appointed a panel to look into its practices after it came under scrutiny for its failure to publicize flaws in its heart devices. The 12-member panel not only urged the company to overhaul its disclosure process, but its findings may provide plaintiffs' lawyers suing Guidant with a road map and also help government agencies investigating the device maker. [C4.] Citigroup's Chief to Add Chairman to Title The board of Citigroup announced that the chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, would soon also hold the chairman's title, which had belonged to Sanford I. Weill for more than 20 years. [C3.] Challenge to iPod's Restrictions Advances in France In a move aimed at Apple's iPod, French lawmakers approved copyright legislation that requires online music vendors to make songs available for use on any digital player. [C6.] For Some Authors, Publishers Skip Hardcover A growing number of publishing companies are offering books by lesser-known authors only as ''paperback originals,'' forgoing the higher profits afforded by publishing a book in hardcover for a chance at attracting more buyers and a more sustained shelf life. [E1.] Wholesale Prices Dropped in February Prices at the wholesale level dropped unexpectedly in February, but excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the cost of goods increased, highlighting the potential for higher inflation later in the year. [C5.] Stocks Decline on Interest Rate Worries Stocks slumped for a second day on fears that interest rates would keep rising. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.85 points, to 1,297.23, its biggest drop in two weeks. The Nasdaq fell 19.88 points, to 2,294.23. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 39.06 points, to 11,235.47. [C8.] Russia Announces Plan for Oil Pipeline to China President Vladimir V. Putin kicked off the ''Year of Russia in China'' celebration by bringing an entourage of 1,000 people to Beijing -- including the executives of top Russian oil and natural gas companies. In keeping with the intense interest of China in securing Russian energy supplies, a deal for natural gas pipelines was announced. The chief executive of Gazprom, Aleksei B. Miller, left, said that two pipelines, planned to skirt Mongolia, would each carry 30 billion to 40 billion cubic meters of gas. He said a western route was likely to be developed first and could start supplying China in five years. [C5.] More Protections for Chemical Plants Urged The nation must move to better protect its chemical plants against terrorism, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said, urging Congress to adopt regulations that the chemical industry has largely endorsed. [A22.] Spanish Court Says Utility Bid Should Be Suspended A Spanish court ruled that Gas Natural's hostile bid for the power utility Endesa should be suspended, saying it might have involved collusion with another Spanish company in violation of European Union regulations.

Offers Buyout Packages to Workers General Motors reached a landmark agreement with the United Automobile Workers intended to sharply reduce the ranks of an entire generation of autoworkers long envied by other blue-collar workers for their rich wages and benefits. G.M. said it would offer buyouts and early retirement packages -- ranging from $35,000 to $140,000 -- to every one of its 113,000 unionized workers in the United States who agrees to leave the company.

[C4.] China Seeks to Win Over Visiting Senators China is responding with respectful attention to the visit of two United States senators who have attacked the country for its economic policies. The reason seems clear: At a time of rising economic nationalism in the United States, China fears that a bill drafted by the senators to impose a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States has a chance to upend economic relations between the world's richest nation and its fastest-growing rival. [C1.] China announced plans to increase existing taxes and impose new ones for everything from gas-guzzling vehicles to chopsticks. [C6.] Ex-Enron Treasurer Contradicts Founder's Claims Ben F. Glisan Jr., Enron's former treasurer, delivered stinging testimony that refuted claims made by Kenneth L.

At the same time, senior executives turned away a barrage of questions about how the company would respond to a plan by a minority shareholder, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, to push for an initial public offering, possibly later this year. [C1.] Morgan Stanley Reports 17% Quarterly Profit Gain Morgan Stanley reported a 17 percent increase in first-quarter profit as the firm's increased focus on riskier trading strategies began to pay off.

[C11.] Interpublic Group Posts Fourth-Quarter Loss The Interpublic group of advertising companies, struggling since 2002 with financial and operational problems, posted a loss for the fourth quarter and restated results for the first three quarters of 2005, which reduced revenue by $14.1 million. It also disclosed that its controller and chief accounting officer, Nicholas S. Cyprus, would leave after less than two years. But an optimistic note from the chief executive, along with the news that an Interpublic media agency, Initiative, had won an assignment from CBS, seemed to resonate with investors more than a recitation of the company's latest woes.

Behind the News -- The vote was the last real hurdle in a decades-long quest for a new stadium. The Yankees at one point threatened to move the team to New Jersey, and more recently Manhattan had been in the running. But in the end the team opted for a site next to the existing stadium in the South Bronx. The Council went along, over objections from neighborhood residents that the project would usurp parkland. SILICON VALLEY The News -- Apple Computer said it would introduce software to enable its Macintosh computers to run the Microsoft Windows operating system as well as its own. Behind the News -- For Apple, which had long ignored and even mocked Microsoft's product, the decision was nothing short of revolutionary. But it was based on a simple business calculus: limiting its computers to a single operating system had limited the company's growth. If Macintoshes can run the vast array of Windows-only software, Apple may grab more than its current 5 percent share of the PC market. WASHINGTON The News -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lobbied Congress to support the administration's effort to aid India's nuclear power program. Behind the News -- Legislators had criticized the deal, citing concerns over India's nuclear weapons program. Ms. Rice sought to reassure the critics, saying she would push India to safeguard its civilian plants and block exports of weapons-making material. The calming words had an effect: several lawmakers offered qualified support for the agreement, leaving the White House optimistic that it would be approved. ISRAEL The News -- The Kadima Party, the winner in Israeli elections last month, said it would form a coalition with the Labor Party. Behind the News -- The announcement does not quite settle the issue of what the new government will look like, as two or three smaller parties will be needed to form a parliamentary majority. But it goes a long way toward ensuring the continuation of the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who is incapacitated by a coma. The parties agree on critical policy, including the removal of more Israeli settlements from the West Bank. TV LAND The News -- Katie Couric, a fixture on NBC's ''Today'' for 15 years, will join CBS, where she will anchor the evening newscast. Behind the News -- For CBS, which courted Ms. Couric for a year, the move is an effort to attract new viewers to its newscast, a ratings also-ran in recent years. The hope is that some of her legions of fans who have made ''Today'' a ratings hit will start watching her at night. CBS may also be thinking that ''Today'' may stumble without her, creating an opening for the network's morning show, which is even more of a ratings laggard.", "headline": {"main": "Play Ball! | April 2-8", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 493, "_id": "4fd2ab848eb7c8105d8988ac", "snippet": " THE BRONX    The News -- The baseball season opened with the Yankees winning a big one: the New York City Council approved plans for a new $800 million stadium.

Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, left, has steadfastly resisted demands to threaten China, arguing that Chinese leaders are making ''progress'' toward a more flexible exchange rate and a more open financial system. [C1.] CLASH OF COMPUTER TITANS -- The Microsoft-Google rivalry is shaping up as a corporate clash for the ages. Pitched corporate battles of the past may shed some light on how this one will turn out. [C1.] MICROSOFT'S GAMING STRATEGY -- Leaving no doubt how much importance Microsoft attaches to its video-game efforts, Bill Gates laid out a vision in which gamers can be connected whether using the Xbox 360 console, a PC or a cellphone. [C5.] TEST OF CORPORATE AID -- Northrop Grumman, the largest builder of warships in the world, is laying out its arguments for another $200 million from Congress to cover losses from Hurricane Katrina. It is a test case of whether such a large company should receive extra help from taxpayers or bear its financial difficulties on its own.

Nine companies, including Verizon Airfone, which pioneered pay phones in the air, are expected to enter bids for the two licenses available.

[A15.] DRUG PLAN PROVES POPULAR -- President Bush's prescription drug plan is emerging as a surprising plus for Republicans in a rocky election season. Rather than angering a crucial bloc, aides say, the plan gives older voters something that always endears politicians to constituents -- money in the pocket. [A20.] GOLD SOARS -- Prices for gold, platinum and other precious metals surged to new heights yesterday as investors weighed an assortment of worries over energy and Iran's nuclear program. [C11.] ANXIETY OVER BOLIVIAN LAND -- Unnerved by the Bolivian government's announcement that it would nationalize oil and gas fields, Brazilian farmers with land in the country are increasingly alarmed at the possibility of another step: a redistribution of Bolivian land. [C6.] WHOLE FOODS STRESSES PRICE -- Whole Foods, the organic food emporium that is all but synonymous with gastronomic indulgence, now wants to be known for something else: low prices. For 10 weeks, Whole Foods is running print advertisements in New York City emphasizing ''value'' and ''deals.'' Advertising. [C1.] CISCO REVENUE UP -- Cisco Systems, the largest network equipment maker, reported a slight decline in quarterly profit due to stock option expensing, while revenue increased the most in seven quarters. [C5.] KPMG INQUIRY -- A federal prosecutor said that a move by KPMG to cut off legal fees to employees caught up in a criminal investigation of the firm over tax shelters played no role in the government's decision not to indict the firm. [C13.] NORDIC ECONOMICS -- Defying conservative American beliefs, Sweden's economy is thriving, even though taxes remain high and the government administers cradle-to-grave social programs that absorb more than half the national output. It is called the Nordic model. The question some Europeans are asking is: Would it work farther south, in Germany or France, or even Italy?

DMX, left, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was arrested after refusing to fasten his seat belt and becoming abusive on an American Airlines flight from New York, The Associated Press reported. He was given a caution, meaning that he accepted responsibility for the offense, which will be recorded. In April Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was jailed after a brawl at a British Airways lounge. He settled by accepting responsibility for using ''threatening words or behavior.'' DMX served a 70-day sentence last year at Rikers Island after pleading guilty to a parole violation from a 2004 incident, when he crashed a vehicle through an airport security gate. Court Rejects Former Wailer's Plea Aston Barrett, the ''Family Man'' who played bass for Bob Marley & the Wailers, yesterday lost his bid for $115 million in royalties from Marley's estate, The Associated Press reported. In High Court in London, Justice Kim Lewison agreed with the Island-Universal label and the Marley family that Mr. Barrett had surrendered rights to royalties from recordings in a 1994 settlement in exchange for $500,000. Mr. Barrett, 59, who sued on behalf of himself and his brother, Carlton, the band's drummer, who died in 1987, faces a legal bill estimated at nearly $3.8 million. The Barretts and Marley recorded from 1969 until Marley's death in 1981. The judge, who barred Mr. Barrett from further action without the court's consent, said, ''At this remove in time, his recollection of events was hazy; and I also consider that, as often happens, he has reconstructed events in his mind according to how he would like them to have been.'' 'Mission: Impossible III' Awaits China's O.K. Will ''Mission: Impossible III'' find China impenetrable? Chinese news media are speculating that a release there of the latest in the series of adventures, starring Tom Cruise, might be jeopardized by images of underwear hanging out to dry and other sights deemed ''inappropriate'' and ''harmful to China,'' in the words of Beijing newspapers, Reuters reported. ''In the Shanghai scenes, all the roofs ands alleys have raggedy clothes hanging from bamboo sticks everywhere,'' noted The Beijing Times. The Beijing News said that the film, which opened in the United States on May 5, had yet to be approved by China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. It added that an official said chances of distribution were ''high,'' although some editing would be needed. Movies: Buy, Burn And Watch on TV The day has arrived when couch potatoes can buy a movie online, burn it onto a DVD and watch it on the living room television screen instead of a computer. One little catch: the movie will be what some people call adult entertainment, others pornography. Vivid Entertainment announced that beginning yesterday it would sell its films through the online movie service CinemaNow, owned in part by the film studio Lions Gate Entertainment, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Blockbuster, The Associated Press reported. ''Leave it to the porn industry once again to take the lead on this stuff,'' said Michael Greeson of the Diffusion Group, a consumer electronics think tank. ''The rest of Hollywood stands back and lets the pornography industry work out all the bugs.'' Because Hollywood makes more money from films on DVD's than in theaters, it is hesitant to anger large retailers by selling DVD-ready downloads directly to consumers. To prevent piracy, a content scrambling system, to keep consumers from copying DVD's and sending files around the Internet, is built into every DVD player. Footnotes Roger Bart, below, returns to the Broadway production of ''The Producers'' today. Mr. Bart, who played Carmen Ghia when the Mel Brooks musical opened five years ago, and then went on to portray the timid accountant-turned-showman Leo Bloom, will return as Bloom, opposite John Treacy Egan as the conniving Max Bialystock, at the St. James Theater. ''Grey Gardens,'' which recently ended its run at Playwrights Horizons, will move to the Walter Kerr Theater in the fall, with performances beginning in October. Both Mary Louise Wilson and Christine Ebersole, who starred as the eccentrics Edith Bouvier Beale and her adult daughter ''Little'' Edie, are to follow the production to Broadway.

Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Right now, is your company doing relatively unsophisticated work such as writing the code that goes into software? A. To a large extent, yes. But there is some amount of system integration consulting work that is beginning to happen. Q. Who are the major players in India? A. Some of the companies have broken away from the rest of the pack and came to be known as Tier 1. Those are Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and Tata. This group of companies has grown from just writing code. They are seen as viable alternatives to the I.B.M.'s and Accentures of the world in certain areas like application outsourcing and application development. Q. You're projecting that you'll grow to $1.3 billion in sales this year from $900 million last year. That's fast growth, but nowhere near I.B.M.'s $90 billion in sales, right? A. Because we operate in a low-cost area, that $1.3 billion in revenue is equivalent to $4 billion or $5 billion of what a Western company would offer in terms of its billing rates. What we need to build is not so much the size and scale, but rather the ability to expand our service offerings. An Accenture, for example, can invest in a partnership with Microsoft and try to provide complete solutions. That's not a capability that any of the outsourcing companies have today. Q. Do the big companies have an advantage because they have been around a long time and have advanced management systems? A. The advantage they have is more in terms of the relationships they enjoy and the brand they have in the marketplace. But in terms of systems and processes, I believe companies like Cognizant have a clear advantage because we have no legacy of having worked for 20 to 30 years with what are today considered archaic processes. We are more current and more modern in terms of applying technology. The gap we have to close is the relationship with the customer. But it's just a question of time. Q. How do the Big Four from India compare with one another? A. Tata is very cost- and price-focused. Infosys tries to be very innovative. Cognizant has a reputation for offering the best customer experience. That's what we concentrate on, building a strong relationship. We are flexible because we adapt to the customer's situation. Wipro is seen as a research and development company because close to half their revenue is from working with telecom companies in chip design and software. Q. Are you hiring Americans to broaden your company's expertise? A. We are hiring a lot of local people, Americans here and Europeans in Europe. Q. How many people work for you, and where are they from? A. We have close to 27,000 people, some 21,000 of whom are in development centers in India. We have small work forces in China and Canada. Then there are about 5,000 in the United States and about 1,000 in Europe, predominantly at customer locations and customer centers. We hire, on average, about 30 people a week in the United States, both local people as well as people of Indian origin who have been here for a long time. Q. What are the challenges in transforming yourself to more of a multinational firm? A. The key thing we are focused on is developing a global mind-set in our leadership. You cannot think of us as an Indian company or an American company. You have to think of us as a global company. If we say, ''Let's focus on the customer,'' there is great alignment among all the people in the company, wherever they're from. Q. Who are your biggest customers here? A. We work with 7 of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer. In health care insurance and H.M.O.'s, 3 of the top 10 global players are our customers. In banking and financial services, 5 or 6 of the top 20 banks and investment banks are our customers. Q. How did you absorb American management know-how? A. We started in 1994 as a development arm of Dun & Bradstreet. Because Dun & Bradstreet has such a great name and such a great brand, we were able to attract many people of Indian origin working in the United States who wanted to return to India and work for a U.S. company. Our entire leadership team of 50 or 60 people has spent at least a year working in the United States and then moved back. That affected our culture and our knowledge of the market. Because of our heritage with D.& B., we also managed to get a lot of processes and people from them. For example, our chief financial officer, chief operating officer and our vice president of corporate development are all from D.& B. Q. Have you also absorbed Americans on your board? A. Our board, right from the beginning, has been international. I'm the only executive member of the board and the only Indian. Our chairman of the board, John Klein, was a former I.B.M. executive. One of the lead directors, Bob Weissman, used to be chairman and chief executive officer of Dun & Bradstreet.

Behind the News -- Republicans held on to the seat, which was left vacant when Randy Cunningham resigned after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. But the thin victory margin of the winner, Brian P. Bilbray, was a sign that the party may be in for difficult times in more competitive districts. Campaigns were already in full swing in some of those districts, long before the traditional Labor Day start of the election season. CYBER-RIVALRY The News -- Google unveiled a new online spreadsheet program, the latest volley in its attacks against its rival Microsoft. Behind the News -- The free program, Google Spreadsheets, is designed to allow multiple users to work on a spreadsheet simultaneously. But more important, perhaps, is that it can read files created in Microsoft's popular program Excel. So it's another step in Google's efforts to make inroads on Microsoft's core business, desktop programs. Microsoft has countered in recent years by expanding its Web offerings. BOOMTOWN The News -- Construction contractors for the Freedom Tower announced they would begin work on the foundation by blasting away bedrock. Behind the News -- While the thought of more explosions at the World Trade Center site might be chilling to residents and workers in Lower Manhattan, those in charge of the project said that the detonations, to be carried out over two months, would hardly be noticeable. Blasting, they added, would produce far less dust and din than the constant pounding of an alternative method, hydraulic rams attached to backhoes. M-M-MEMORIES The News -- Barbra Streisand announced she would perform in 20 cities this fall, her first concert tour in a dozen years. Behind the News -- Since Ms. Streisand, 64, never really retired, it's not a comeback tour. A more accurate description might be ''marathon fund-raising event.'' The singer, who has long used her concerts to raise money for political causes, said she would donate proceeds this time to educational, environmental and women's health groups. PLAYTIME The News -- The 32-team World Cup soccer tournament got under way in Germany with the opening match in Munich. Behind the News -- Concerns about how the monthlong event might be affected by racist fans, bribable referees, an influx of prostitutes and even the shape of the ball dominated much of the discussion in the weeks leading up to it. Most of the worries melted away as play began, although German and English fans had to be separated by police officers in Frankfut.

The most direct method, of course, is to pay a dazzling salary, a common tactic at many of this country's elite law firms, which now pay first-year associates up to $145,000 a year (not including bonuses). Tech companies like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, woo engineers with visions of autonomy and stock options. Tighter financial constraints have prompted the social sector, on the other hand, to test different enticements. New York City recently introduced a program of housing subsidies -- up to $14,600 annually -- available to some teachers who might otherwise look for work elsewhere because of the area's stratospheric housing prices. And a few years ago, the National Institutes of Health began an ambitious experiment when it received Congressional authorization, and many millions of dollars, to create an educational loan-repayment program designed in large part to increase the ranks of this country's ''physician-scientists'' -- that is, M.D.'s who forgo private practice for a career that mixes patient care, typically at a university hospital, with research into diseases, diagnoses and treatments. In the entire United States, there are perhaps only 15,000 physician-scientists, down from more than 23,000 in the mid-1980's.

[C8.] A SHIFT AT MICROSOFT -- Microsoft plans to offer a strategy on Monday describing how it intends to transform the telecommunications world in much the same way it changed the computing world in the 1980's. Its new approach centers on systems for the workplace that blend desktop computers with office and mobile phones, a combination known as ''unified communications.'' [C6.] PETS AND GAMES AT MTV -- MTV, a unit of Viacom, plans to introduce a cellphone-based version of its popular Neopets Web site tomorrow. The site, which MTV bought a year ago for $160 million, lets users adopt, feed and nurture their pets and do battle with cartoonish creatures including the catlike Aisha and the dragonlike Scorchio. [C2.] ACTIVITY, BUT FEW CUSTOMERS -- Despite WiFly's ubiquity in Taiwan -- with 4,100 hot spot access points reaching 90 percent of the population -- just 40,000 of Taipei's 2.6 million residents have agreed to pay for the service since January. That such a vast and reasonably priced wireless network has attracted so few users in an otherwise tech-hungry metropolis should give pause to civic leaders in Chicago, Philadelphia and dozens of other American cities. [C1.] A NEW RULE AT MSNBC -- Dan Abrams, an on-air anchor who will become the new day-to-day boss of MSNBC, acknowledged that he was still in the learning stages of his new job, his first management job in television. While steering away from suggestions that an overhaul of MSNBC is imminent, he did suggest that he would push right away for more breaking news coverage during the channel's daytime hours.

ALLIANCE -- The boards of Nissan and Renault voted to explore a three-way alliance with General Motors, putting pressure on G.M. to decide whether it wants two foreign companies, and their charismatic chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, to play a role in its restructuring. G.M.'s board is scheduled to meet Friday. [Page C1.] U.S. AUTOMAKERS' SALES FALL -- High gas prices sapped sales of the profitable pickups and sport-utility vehicles made by Detroit's automakers in June, while their Asian rivals continued to benefit from their reputations for fuel efficiency. Japan's Toyota and Honda posted record sales for the first half of 2006. [C1.] CHRYSLER SEAT FOR UNION LEADER -- Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers, has been nominated for a seat on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board. The move would place him on the company's top oversight body just a year before the union begins negotiating its labor contracts with the domestic automakers. [C4.] OUTLOOK FOR AIRBUS -- The weekend boardroom purge at Airbus and its parent company has eased an immediate management crisis. But analysts and industry executives said it would do little to solve the more deep-rooted political problems at Europe's flagship plane maker. [C1.] BAE'S EXPANSION RECONSIDERED -- BAE, Europe's largest military contractor, may be forced to curtail its trans-Atlantic expansion plans temporarily after learning that a big stake it holds in Airbus is worth much less than it expected.

[C1.] ENERGY FROM WASTE -- Through rain or shine, gusts or stillness, cows and hogs and turkeys spew forth a steady stream of manure, one of nature's richest sources of natural gas. And now, farmers and entrepreneurs are recognizing that the product can yield a steady stream of revenue and profit, too. Slowly but steadily they are replacing the malodorous lagoons used to treat the waste with machines that can wrest energy from excrement. [C1.] MORE INTERNET OVERSIGHT IN CHINA -- Chinese authorities have announced their intention to step up their efforts to police and control the Internet and other communications technologies, including instant messaging and cellphones. [A3.] IDENTITY THEFT ON THE INTERNET -- The ranks of identity-fraud victims have grown as computer-savvy thiefs forge new conduits for crime through the Internet. [A1.] ONLINE GAMBLING DEBATE -- Teams of lobbyists are facing off on Capitol Hill in a contest over whether the United States should restrict wagering on the Web. [A11.] DATA SHOW SLOWING ECONOMY -- The manufacturing sector expanded at a slower rate than expected in June and construction spending declined in May, reinforcing signs that the economy is slowing. [C3.] FEES FOR CALLING CARD ISSUERS -- The Federal Communications Commission has ruled that issuers of prepaid calling cards must pay connection fees and help subsidize phone service in rural areas. [C9.] WINE ALONG THE GREAT WALL -- Wine makers in China, backed by foreign investment and technical advice, are trying to make a giant leap in standards to keep pace with the evolving tastes of more widely traveled and sophisticated Chinese. One French wine maker, Nicolas Billot-Grima, above, has gone even further and has planted vines within sight of the Great Wall of China, hoping eventually to produce an export-quality vintage. [C7.] EUROPE'S MICROSOFT FINE BACKED -- Antitrust regulators in the European Union gave unanimous support to the plan by the European Commission to again fine Microsoft millions of dollars for failing to comply with a 2004 ruling against it, people following the case said.

[C3.] EUROPE SUGGESTS RUSSIA PACT -- Two European Union officials unexpectedly floated the idea of opening talks with Moscow on forming a free trade area encompassing Europe and Russia. A European Union spokesman, however, said a free trade deal with Moscow was a distant prospect, though one that could not be ruled out.

[Page A1.] STYMIED IN GENEVA -- Talks aimed at reaching a new global trade agreement collapsed, touching off recriminations between the United States and Europe over farm trade barriers and dealing a blow to the Bush administration's international economic agenda. [A1.] LARGEST LEVERAGED BUYOUT -- HCA, the for-profit hospital company, agreed to sell itself to three private equity firms and the family of Senator Bill Frist, the company's founders. The deal is the largest leveraged buyout in history, eclipsing the $30.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989. The buyout trend is expected to continue.

But Mr. Panke did not contest the rule. [C3.] TAKING THEIR CHANCES -- Gamblers anywhere in the world can use the Internet to place wagers on sporting events and play casino games.

But to judge from a test of an early version, Microsoft still has some critical work to do. [E3.] SEARCH FOR THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT -- With more than 80 companies under investigation concerning stock options, it is unclear where the line of criminality will be drawn. The vast majority of cases may wind up being civil matters. [C1.] WINNING WHILE LOSING -- Stock options made Gregory L. Reyes, the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, very rich, and now it is abuse of options that may send him to prison. He and the company are prime examples of how executives can enrich themselves even while many public shareholders -- and the company itself -- lose money.

[C1.] NEW CHALLENGE FOR SCRIPPS -- The stock price of Scripps -- once an old-line newspaper company -- has outperformed that of its peers largely because of growth in its cable network unit. But the media landscape has continued to change rapidly, and now cable networks are, like newspapers, under new competitive pressure as well, from the Web. The question for Scripps, as with many other media companies, is whether it can continue to adapt -- and do so quickly enough.

[C1.] NEW WAYS TO SHOP ON WEB -- Two new shopping services, Mpire.com and Slide.com, present variations on the traditional method of finding items online. Mpire allows shoppers to view the most recent selling prices of millions of items from sources like eBay and Craigslist. ''I want to show consumers what prices they should actually be paying,'' said Matthew Hulett, Mpire's chief executive, above. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C6.] ROLE OF IMAGES IN CONFLICT -- Although doctored and stage-managed photographs out of Lebanon garnered their share of headlines last week, they are just a part of a larger, underlying issue: the role of images in fairly portraying the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. [C1.] DIGITAL DETECTIVE WORK -- The recent discovery that a Lebanese photographer had manipulated pictures he took for Reuters raised several questions about the standards of photo-journalism in the age of widespread digital photography. The incident also increased the pressure on news photo editors, who edit and publish thousands of photographs under deadline each day, to catch digital alterations. [C4.] SEEING THE END AS NEAR -- When Israel and Hezbollah began trading blows last month, the community at RaptureReady.com, a fundamentalist Christian site dedicated to the proposition that the end times are near, was atwitter, taking the conflict as another sign of an impending judgment day. Tom Zeller Jr.: Link by Link. [C3.] NEW ERA OF READER-REPORTERS -- The German tabloid Bild has joined a growing number of European publications that are taking advantage of cellphone technology to reach new levels of reader interactivity and, some say, invasion of privacy. [C5.] MARKETING ACROSS AMERICA -- When an advertising columnist left Madison Avenue -- and the rest of New York City -- behind for a 16-state road trip, he discovered new trends. Among them were large Starbucks stores turning up at service plazas along places like the Ohio Turnpike, joining fast-food mainstays like Burger King and McDonald's. Stuart Elliott: Advertising.

[Page C1.] A WARNING FOR STUDIOS -- Warner's recent tumble in the studio rankings is a cautionary tale for Hollywood. As the studios begin to shrink their slates and make fewer movies, they are increasing their reliance on the big, expensive extravaganzas. Sometimes they succeed, as ''Batman Begins'' and the ''Harry Potter'' movies have for Warner. But the lackluster results for Warner's blockbusters this summer show that the large tentpole features are not sure things, after all.

Google said it earned $733 million in the third quarter, up 92 percent from a year ago. Revenue climbed to $2.69 billion, with 44 percent of that coming from outside the United States. [Page C3.] DOW ABOVE 12,000 -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above the psychologically important 12,000 level for the first time, indicating that investors were increasingly confident that the economy was poised to perform the rare feat of slowing without stalling. The performance in the months ahead will depend, in part, how gracefully the economy handles the slowing housing market. [C1.] BIG BANK EARNINGS -- Citigroup seemed to stumble and Bank of America appeared to strut through a messy third quarter as the country's two biggest banks contended with pressures of a slowing economy and higher interest rates. [C3] CBS SETTLES ACCUSATIONS -- CBS became the first radio corporation to settle accusations of illicit pay-for-play practices made by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. CBS, which runs approximately 180 radio stations, agreed to adopt more stringent policies on its stations' dealings with record labels and to make a $2 million payment to New York charities. [C3.] MEDICINE VS. MARKETING -- For many doctors, it's an irresistible pitch: a $250 profit from a 15-minute test. With that lure, some 12,000 of the nation's physicians have purchased an automated device that checks patients for nerve disease. Specialists say the problem is that many general practitioners are not qualified to do such tests. [A1.] HIGHER PROFITS AT DRUG MAKERS -- Drug makers continued to post strong profit gains, led by Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, which reported that its third-quarter earnings had more than doubled from a year earlier. Eli Lilly, Novartis, and Wyeth also reported higher quarterly profits. [C2] VIDEO GAME WARS -- Laying the groundwork for a battle against rival Microsoft, Sony said that 21 games would be available for the PlayStation 3 game console when it goes on sale next month. Sony also plans to highlight the console's ability to play high-definition DVD's in Sony's Blu-ray format. [C11.] BANNER YEAR IN HONG KONG -- In a reflection of China's growing prominence in international finance, Hong Kong is set for a banner year in global markets with more money raised by companies selling shares to the public here than on the biggest exchanges in New York and London. Pricing will be set today for the world's largest IPO ever, that of China's biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. [C1.] BEYOND REGULATORS' REACH -- Every month, roughly 19,000 households across the country write check to Christian Care Ministry. The members pool their health expenses and contributions and the ministry writes checks to health care providers. Such payments totaled $57 million in the latest fiscal year. While ministry members say they are helping to carry each others burdens, some Florida state officials see what they would call unregulated health insurance. [C1.] RULING AGAINST GRASSO -- A New York judge ruled that Richard A. Grasso, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, would have to return as much as $100 million of a fiercely contested $139.5 million retirement payout to the exchange The judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said that Mr. Grasso did not disclose to his fellow directors on the board of the exchange the extent to which his soaring compensation had caused his pension and savings to balloon. [A1.] MERGER REVERBERATIONS -- The $8 billion combination of Chicago's derivatives markets is being heralded as good for Chicago and good for the exchanges. But in Europe, it is raising concerns at banks and rival exchanges that it may increase costs or stifle competition. One of the biggest fears in London where the local derivatives exchange will be dwarfed, is that it creates a so-called vertical silo, or a market where one giant entity is both a trading platform and a clearing system. [C8.] NBC STAFF CUTBACKS -- NBC said it planned to reduce its 6,000-person newsgathering staff by an estimated 5 percent, or 300 people to adapt to the migration of news viewers to the Internet and eliminate overlaps in news coverage. Steve Capus, president of NBC News, said the bulk of the cuts would come from eliminating jobs already vacant, as well as from early retirements and voluntary buyouts, but that some layoffs were inevitable. [C4.] LOWER COST PROGRAMMING -- As part of the extensive cost-cutting program it announced yesterday, NBC intends to dramatically alter its prime-time programming, starting in the fall of 2007, filling the 8 p.m. hour each night of the week with lower-cost, unscripted programs and saving its more expensive scripted comedies and dramas for the 9-to-11 block. [C1.] WEAK NEWSPAPER PROFITS -- Newspaper companies continued to show weakness, with The New York Times Company and the Tribune Company both reporting lackluster earnings, citing soft advertising sales as a major culprit. At the Times Company, the slowdown ''is expected to continue through the end of the year,'' said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. [C7.] ONLINE Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. McDonald's reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter profitmeeting a better-than-expected forecast it gave last week. (REUTERS) The UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest provider of health insurance, said third-quarter net income rose 38 percent after acquisitions raised the number of policyholders. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Travelers packed planes operated by Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines over the summer, but Continental's third-quarter profit grew while Southwest's earnings fell in another sign that traditional carriers were narrowing the gap with low-cost rivals.

[Page C1.] INTERNET VIA SATELLITE -- Companies like WildBlue and Hughes Network Systems, which provide Internet service via satellite, are filling one of the biggest gaps in the country's digital infrastructure. Roughly 15 million households cannot get broadband from their phone or cable provider because the companies have been slow to expand their high-speed networks in areas where there are not enough customers to generate an adequate profit. [C1.] BIG PAYDAY AT GOLDMAN -- Traders at Wall Street investment banks are priming themselves for another big bonus haul this year. And Raanan A. Agus, manager of one of Goldman Sachs' largest internal hedge funds will be in line for one of the firm's richer paydays. He is evidence that the real money on Wall Street is being made not by investment bankers cutting high-profile deals, but by anonymous traders making risky, bets with their firm's capital. [C1.] VALUE OF METS DEAL -- Experts in the realms of sports marketing, corporate identity and brand building offered sharply divergent views of the value of the huge deal that will name the new ballpark of the New York Mets for Citigroup. Under the deal, the new Mets stadium, scheduled to open in spring 2009, will be called Citi Field. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.] IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE -- The Mets stadium deal could have been worse. The new ballpark could have been named for some company overcharging in Iraq or a scandalized corporation or a geeky-sounding electronics firm that may or may not still exist when the gates open in 2009. Sports of the Times: George Vecsey [D1.] READY FOR BOARDING -- Airlines have been boarding passengers for decades, long enough, it would seem, to have figured out the best way to get people on and off a plane. But they haven't. Spurred by financial pressures and packed planes, airlines have come up with a wide variation of boarding techniques, from the simple back-to-front protocol to much more complicated strategies. The goal is to get planes back in the air faster. [C1.] BATTLE OVER HEALTH PLAN -- A legal battle over a plan to offer free or low-cost health care to all uninsured residents in San Francisco has been set in motion by a group of the city's most important and beloved constituents: restaurants. A culinary trade group with more than 800 members has sued the city, saying a central provision in the program violates federal employment law. [A14.] FEDERAL HEALTH PLAN -- The health insurance industry has proposed an expansion of Medicaid and new tax breaks with the goal of guaranteeing coverage for all children in three years and for virtually all adults within 10 years. New members of Congress, especially those elected on a pledge to help the uninsured, are likely to embrace many of the proposals, which provide a benchmark for debate on the issue. [A14.] MEN'S HEALTH -- In recent years, women's health has been a national priority. Pink ribbons warn of breast cancer. Pins shaped like red dresses raise awareness about heart disease. Yet statistics show that men are more likely than women to suffer an early death. Now some scientists are beginning to ask a question that in some circles might be considered politically incorrect: Is men's health getting short shrift? [F1.] VIETNAM TRADE VOTE -- Legislation to normalize trade relations with Vietnam was defeated in the House, four days before President Bush makes his first visit to the country. The measure failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority it needed to pass under a procedure adopted in an effort to rush it through with limited debate. The measure will be voted on again, possibly as early as today, under normal procedures which will require only a majority for passage. [C1.] MICROSOFT ALLIANCE -- Microsoft plans to unveil a technology industry alliance today to make software from competing companies and partners work better together. The move is latest effort by Microsoft to move from being a company that insists on the advantages of its own products to one that can adapt when customers use other companies' goods. The alliance will be announced in Barcelona, Spain, at an event for European software developers. [C3.] NEW TIVO FEATURES -- TiVo plans to introduce features that will allow people to use its digital video recorders to watch some video programming from the Internet on their televisions. Until now, TiVo has not been able to tap into the explosion of Web video Internet. The new features, to be announced today, are designed to change that. [C3.] LOSSES AT MEAT PROCESSOR -- Tyson Foods, the world's biggest meat processor, reported its third straight quarterly loss because of lower chicken and beef prices. Tyson said it would return to profit in 2007 and its stock price posted the biggest one-day gain since July. [C11.] HEDGE FUND SCRUTINY -- The Securities and Exchange Commission expects to file more lawsuits aimed at hedge funds accused of illegal trading and violating their clients' trust, the agency's chief enforcer said.

Those representatives, in turn, are encouraged to recruit others and are promised that they will receive a portion of new enlistees' profits. The companies profit, at least in part, by collecting increased revenue and fees paid by new sales representatives. In April, citing hundreds of fraud investigations, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new rules for multilevel marketing companies and related businesses. [Page C1.] SHORTCUT TO FASHION -- For fashionistas in lower tax brackets, reproducing the latest hip look from Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton can mean endless clicking through online retail sites and hit-or-miss searches on Google or shopping engines like Shopping.com. Now a new search site, Like.com, offers a shortcut for the budget-minded. The site and its chief executive, Munjal Shah, left, rely on artificial-intelligence technology to search images on the Web, and serve up goods for sale that visually match items on a shopper's wish list. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C4.] LIFE IN THE STUDIO -- In an era when producers, directors and popular actors are required to toe a stricter line, even Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is feeling the squeeze. His contribution to Disney cannot be underestimated. He has produced 17 films for the studio since 1991. They have brought in $5 billion. As part of a shift under Robert A. Iger, the new Disney chief executive, the studio pledged to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the company's businesses. That means Mr. Bruckheimer is now in the onscreen amusement park business. [C1.] MOVING ON AFTER XBOX -- The hoopla was still swelling around November's debut of the Xbox 360, when some on its development team began conceiving a new product. Tomorrow, after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release the result of that research: the Zune. At a glance, it looks like yet another aspiring iPod rival. But the Zune can do something that no other player can claim: it can locate other Zune players and wirelessly exchange content with a few touches of a big shiny button. [C1.] MUSIC FILLS THE AIR -- The upscale department store Nordstrom, which has taken a chance on up-and-coming designers, is now betting on a different set of rising stars: musicians. Beginning this holiday season, the retailer will develop and sell a collection of CDs that, over time, is expected to rival the one carried by Starbucks, its corporate neighbor in Seattle. [C11.] TAKING A NEW PATH -- Two big advertisers known for following traditional ways of marketing products are expanding their efforts to become a little less conventional. Both, coincidentally, share the same creative and media agencies, which are also trying to demonstrate their eagerness to explore the brave world of new media. The advertisers are the General Electric Company and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. The agencies are both part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO Worldwide in New York for the creative parts of the campaigns and OMD for the media elements. Everyone on Madison Avenue ''is looking to push the envelope, find what is going to be the next big thing,'' said Jennifer Gordineer, group director for national investment on the PepsiCo account at OMD. Advertising, Stuart Elliott. [C8.] GETTING A SECOND CHANCE -- Even adults, it seems, are getting a little sick of their childhoods, long after everyone else has. So TV Land, the network best-known for reruns of ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' is unveiling programming to appeal to what the network sees as one of the next obsessions for baby boomers: optimism about having second careers and changing lifestyles. Having recently produced reality shows with Farrah Fawcett and Mr. T, the network, which is owned by Viacom, is now turning its cameras on George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion-turned-grill purveyor. [C10.] FINANCING FOR ETHANOL -- The Mascoma Corporation, a company that is trying to produce ethanol from nontraditional sources, has received $30 million from a group of prominent venture capital investors. The investment, which is led by General Catalyst Partners, and includes Khosla Ventures, Flagship Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and others, is the latest in a string of venture capital financings of alternative energy companies. Khosla and Flagship invested $9 million in Mascoma earlier this year.

In the last 12 months, news reports revealed that CBS was working on as many as seven scripts for telenovelas, that ABC had invested in as many as 45 existing telenovela storylines, and NBC was jumping in to adapt telenovelas already produced by Telemundo. But not a single telenovela project has been put into production by any of those networks. [C1.] ONLINE AD PRICES RISING Prices for some online advertising are going up, and some retailers, like Matt Coffin, left, president of LowerMyBills.com, and brand marketers wonder if publishers will be so emboldened by a strong advertising market that they will raise the prices of ads sharply. E-Commerce Report. [C4.] R.I.M. SILENT ON OPTIONS REVIEW In an investor conference call last week, the chairman of Research In Motion, the Canadian company that created the BlackBerry, had plenty of cheery news about sales and profits. But he had no comment on the review of R.I.M.'s past stock options grants, which was undertaken in late September. The company has given few details on the review to investors or regulators, making it difficult to assess its potential impact or full extent. [C1.] SPREADING THE WORD DIGITALLY Word-of-mouth advertising -- sharing information with friends, relatives and colleagues to propagate interest in a company or product -- has been around for decades, but with the advent of the Internet, it has taken on new life. Companies are using online message boards and chats to get the word out for little or no cash investment. [C3.] A STATION KEEPS AIR AMERICA While negotiations to buy the beleaguered radio network Air America have kept its future in a state of limbo, the company had one bit of good news last week. WXXM-FM, a station in Madison, Wis., owned by Clear Channel Communications, rescinded a decision to drop the liberal network in favor of Fox Sports Radio. [C6.] IN DEFENSE OF PLASMA Panasonic, the consumer electronics company, is the world's biggest seller of plasma TVs and has long promoted the benefits of that technology compared to liquid-crystal display, another flat-panel TV product, even though it also sells a full lineup of L.C.D. sets. But the company says it believes that plasma technology is under unfair attack from its competitors. [C4.] CHINA LIFE PRICES ITS OFFERING China Life Insurance Company, the country's biggest life insurer, set the price range in its $3.6 billion Shanghai initial public offering lower than expected Sunday, in a move that is likely to ensure huge demand for the offer. [C5.] A TECHNOLOGY IS PASSING For the first time, more American households have a DVD player than have a VCR, according to a survey by Nielsen Media Research. [C3.] BATTLE FOR A DOMAIN NAME The latest battle over an Internet domain name is being fought between an online entrepreneur and a MGM Studios, which is looking to make a long-delayed film sequel and wants the Web domain Wargames.com. [C6.] READERSHIP INCREASE OF ONE Readers may be abandoning the printed versions of newspapers, but over the last couple of years, at least one person seems to have started reading them, at least sometimes. He lives in the White House. [C6.] YANKED FROM THE SEAT POCKET Northwest Airlines has withdrawn the December issue of its in-flight magazine, WorldTraveler, which has a cover featuring Carmelo Anthony, left, one of the National Basketball Association basketball players suspended for brawling last week.

A1 Ethiopia at War in Somalia Ethiopia officially plunged into war with Somalia's Islamist forces, bombing targets inside Somalia and putting Ethiopian ground troops on the march in an escalation that could turn Somalia's internal crisis into a religious conflict that engulfs the entire Horn of Africa. A1 At Axis of Episcopal Split Archbishop Peter J. Akinola of Nigeria, a man whose reputation has been built on his stance against homosexuality and who has created an offshoot of his Nigerian church in North America, has become the spiritual head of 21 conservative churches in the United States. The churches opted to leave the Episcopal Church over its decision to consecrate a gay bishop and allow churches to bless same-sex unions. A1 Iran Defiant After Sanctions Iran reacted defiantly to the United Nations Security Council resolution imposing sanctions over the country's nuclear program. Iranian officials vowed to continue efforts to enrich uranium and warned that the sanctions would change Iran's relationship with the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency. A14 Hamas Rebuffs Israeli Move Hamas, the militant Islamic faction that leads the Palestinian government, dismissed as inconsequential the Israeli concessions made a day earlier to Mahmoud Abbas, above, the Palestinian Authority president. A10 Wealth Disparity in Argentina Five years after an economic collapse in Argentina, its economy has grown faster than any other in South America. But the fruits of the expansion are not being shared by all, and as a result, economic inequality has intensified.

A4 A Split on Plan for Viking Ships The University of Oslo has decided to move three grand Viking ships, probably by truck and barge, to a new museum across town, despite claims that the thousand-year-old oak vessels could fall apart en route.

A8 NATIONAL A16-22 Famed Surgeon's Care Stirs Debate on Treatment When Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, then 97 and one of the most influential heart surgeons in history, suffered a dissecting aortic aneurysm, he became the oldest survivor of an operation he had devised to repair torn aortas. But his treatment also stirred debate over how far to go in treating someone so old, and making risky decisions that can save lives. A1 Pork Projects Cost Seats A timeworn bit of political wisdom has been that larding one's district with pork projects can act as an incumbency protection program, and the Republican leaders in Congress ardently followed that principle. But the pursuit of earmarks -- special local projects that circumvent the normal budgeting process -- cost two senators and four House members their seats in the last election. A1 Country Church Loses Name The 152-year-old Hog Mountain Baptist Church in Georgia has been renamed after a posh new subdivision nearby, Hamilton Mill. That move makes perfect sense to some but has raised an outcry among old-timers, current and former church members, and the local historical society. A16 Boston City Hall May Relocate Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston has proposed selling City Hall, a hulking gray concrete box of a building, and moving city government to an undeveloped waterfront parcel. But the announcement has strengthened the will of City Hall's defenders; some see it as a seminal building in the city's history and do not want it to move to a hard-to-reach waterfront location. A16 Nuclear Firms Seek Guidelines The nuclear power industry has asked the government to specify how new nuclear plants should minimize damage from airplane attacks, weeks after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided not to institute requirements on building new plants that are tougher than the rules that prevailed decades ago, when the old ones were built.

B7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 NYU Fund-Raising Efforts Grow Increasingly Complex John Sexton, president of New York University, is heading an increasingly elaborate campaign to bring in $2.5 billion, including development teams and marketers who scour for every graduate with money. University officials say the measures are necessary to cover the cost of providing education and financial aid. B1 Split Over H.I.V. Test Consent A yearlong effort by New York City's health commissioner to do away with a state requirement that patients give their written consent before being tested for H.I.V. has created a sharp rift among doctors and advocates for people with H.I.V. and AIDS. B1 Town Is Center of Deaf Life Rochester, N.Y., is home to the nation's largest deaf population per capita, with about 90,000 people who are deaf or hard of hearing living in its metropolitan area. The community's embracing of all things deaf has in turn provided comfort to a city where many of its industries and its young people have fled for more prosperous parts.

Clark, who was elected to Congress, is staggering by any standard -- estimated to be from 18 to 25 candidates long.

C1 Ardor Cools for Telenovelas The low-budget soap opera genre called telenovelas has become the staple of television in Latin America, spurring CBS, ABC and NBC to announce plans to develop telenovelas for American audiences. But not a single show has since been produced by any of the major networks. C1 Silence on Stock Options Jim Balsillie, the chairman of Research In Motion, creator of the BlackBerry, has yet to comment on the review of R.I.M.'s past stock options grants. The company has given few details on the review to investors or regulators, making it difficult to assess its potential impact. C1 Hewlett's Big Aspirations Hewlett-Packard's turnaround was verified this year when profits from PCs, corporate servers and storage devices nearly doubled from last year. It sold more PCs than any other maker and claimed the title of the world's largest technology company.
