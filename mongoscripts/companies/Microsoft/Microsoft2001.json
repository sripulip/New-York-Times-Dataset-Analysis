To Plains Indians of the 18th and 19th centuries, magnificently decorated hide shirts were symbols of bravery earned only by the most courageous in battle. Obsessively fringed and embellished with porcupine quills, paint, ribbon, hair and, later, tight patterns of colored glass beads, the shirts took on the spirits of their owners and even today are made for wear at powwows and in recognition of more peaceful accomplishments. Celebrating the power of this glory gear, almost 50 dazzlers in the museum's collection are on view, dating from about 1820 to the 1990's. Among the more fascinating examples are a brilliantly painted Crow shirt (1890) with beadwork in geometric patterns and frizzy fringes of dyed magenta and yellow hair, and a Lakota shirt, circa 1890, that sports United States Army insignia, the American flag and stepped tepees topped by crosses, all worked in porcupine quills and metal beads.

In doing so, however, the agency laid down conditions intended to make America Online's popular instant-messaging service compatible with the systems of Internet rivals. Officials said the conditions were imposed because the merger joined the world's largest Internet company, AOL, with the nation's second-largest cable company, Time Warner. Regulators said they feared that the company could take advantage of its dominance over instant messaging to monopolize related Internet services that might be developed for high-speed cable connections. Executives of the companies closed the deal shortly after the agency's announcement. The commission's order, issued a year and a day after the announcement of the merger, is the final major decision by the commission under the leadership of William E. Kennard, who said that he intended to step down before President-elect George W. Bush took office on Jan. 20. All five commissioners supported approval of the merger, although only the three Democrats voted to impose conditions on the instant messaging service as the price of completing the deal. ''The conditions we impose today are forward-looking and fair,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''They preserve the openness of the Internet. They protect consumers and avoid heavy-handed regulation by using a narrowly tailored market-opening approach. And they ensure that neither AOL Time Warner nor a government agency will pick winners and losers in this dynamic marketplace.'' Last month the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the companies agreed to stringent conditions meant to ensure competition in providing Internet services and the interactive television systems of the future. Executives of the companies had pledged to open their instant messaging services within a year. But F.C.C. officials said that the voluntary commitment of AOL, while laudable, was not enough, and that the order would actually require the company to open its messaging services. The companies made it clear that they could live with those demands. ''The conditions on open access are consistent with our memorandum of understanding that we signed last year, and our business model,'' said Kathy McKiernan, an AOL spokeswoman. ''We believe the instant messaging conditions were unnecessary, but we're pleased that they do not affect our current services, and they will have no financial impact on the company.'' Moreover, the lasting effects of the F.C.C.'s order on future policy makers may be fleeting. In a sign of the sharp shift in direction the agency may take under the Bush administration, one of the two commissioners who sharply dissented on the conditions imposed on the merger was Michael K. Powell, the leading inside contender to be the next head of the agency. ''I believe the majority has given in too much to their collective imaginations, rather than sound reasoning based on the record, in reaching some of the conditions on the merger,'' Mr. Powell wrote. ''This order makes clear that the F.C.C. has jurisdiction to regulate virtually every Internet product.'' Mr. Powell's father, Gen. Colin L. Powell, has been nominated as secretary of state. General Powell also serves on the board of America Online. Michael Powell decided not to remove himself from the review after ethics officials at the F.C.C. said his relationship to his father did not pose a regulatory problem. Consumer groups hailed tonight's decision. Combined with conditions imposed on the deal last month by the Federal Trade Commission, they said, the terms have made the deal more attractive to consumers. ''In the face of enormous dangers to consumers, federal regulators have imposed critical consumer protections on the merger of AOL and Time Warner,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''The combined actions of the F.C.C. and the F.T.C. have transformed a merger that threatened competition into one that could actually expand consumers' choices for high-speed Internet and interactive TV services.'' Calling the order a ''tremendous win for consumers,'' Edward Adler, a Time Warner spokesman, said, ''AOL Time Warner will be uniquely positioned to speed the development of the interactive medium and the growth of all its businesses for the benefit of consumers worldwide.'' The order today was a compromise among the Democrats, and was hammered out after weeks of intense negotiations. Compounding the complexity of the review was the fact that the agency has never confronted many of the regulatory questions posed by the merger of the two companies. At bottom, the questions raised -- about instant messaging, telephone service on the Internet and interactive television -- involve issues that do not fit neatly into a regulatory scheme created long before the Internet. AOL's instant messaging services are a kind of hybrid that combines the most attractive features of telephones and e-mail by allowing two or more computer users to communicate virtually instantaneously. The company's two instant messaging services, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ, have more than 140 million registered users, dwarfing competing services offered by Microsoft, Yahoo and others. Under the order, AOL must make the system compatible with the instant messaging system of at least one rival immediately once AOL Time Warner augments its own service to allow the exchange of live video. Within six months it would have to make its messaging system compatible with those of at least two other rivals. Mr. Kennard said the commission had approached the proposed merger from a historical framework, hoping to avoid a repeat of AT&T's growth earlier this century into a monopoly that effectively shut out any competitors by making its telephone system incompatible with those of rivals. ''The fundamental issue is not different from the interconnection issues of the last century,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''The emerging monopoly of AT&T occurred because it did not allow other companies to interconnect. What has made this review challenging is that the Internet has grown and flourished by not being dominated by a single entity. But now the fear has emerged that one entity may be able to dominate this marvelous new means of communicating'' through instant messaging. At the same time, there was concern about being too heavy-handed in regulating the Internet, particularly because technological changes have come so rapidly in the largely unregulated industry. The commissioners thus rejected proposals to set the standards for compatible instant messaging services or precise deadlines. Instead, the agency decided to use AOL's commitment to make its system compatible with those of rivals within the next year, and impose penalties on the company if it fails to live up to that schedule. ''All of the commissioners wanted to do something, but do it in an Internet-friendly way,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''The days of government micromanaging protocols and standards are passed. We can't expect government lawyers to write technical standards. But we also tried to look at this from a consumer's point of view and ask: 'Does the consumer have a choice? Is there a danger that a single player becomes so dominant that other players can't thrive?' '' Mr. Kennard, who has led the agency since 1997 and served before that as its general counsel, gave his farewell address to the commission this morning. He choked with emotion as he praised the staff and his fellow commissioners.", "headline": {"main": "F.C.C.

Although they come from widely different times and places, the artists in this show share a theme: war and its horrors. Goya's masterpiece, the series of 83 etchings known as ''The Disasters of War,'' is shown with 83 Goya-inspired etchings by the contemporary English artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, as well as blown-up photographs from the Chapmans's gruesome World War II tableau ''Hell,'' on view in London. The wild card here is Henry Darger (1892-1973), an Outsider artist whose maniacal vision of war was expressed in hundreds of watercolors depicting little girls pursued by ruthless male marauders. Darger's inclusion seems a bit of curatorial overreach, as his war was a personal crisis that began and ended in his mind. But the display of such a large slice of his work is the most rewarding reason for visiting this show.

Although they come from widely different times and places, the artists in this show share a theme: war and its horrors. Goya's masterpiece, the series of 83 etchings known as ''The Disasters of War,'' is shown with 83 Goya-inspired etchings by the contemporary English artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, as well as blown-up photographs from the Chapmans' gruesome World War II tableau ''Hell,'' on view in London. The wild card here is Henry Darger (1892-1973), an outsider artist whose maniacal vision of war was expressed in hundreds of watercolors depicting little girls pursued by ruthless male marauders. Darger's inclusion seems a bit of curatorial overreach, as his war was a personal crisis that began and ended in his mind.

A legend in calligraphy and book design, Mr. Zapf, who uses passages from the writers Goethe and Hesse in his lettering samples, is equally renowned as an innovator in desktop publishing and word processing. In 1973, Mr. Zapf designed Marconi, the first font created for digital composition, where letters are printed across a grid of small boxes, some programmed to be black, others to be white. His straight, square letters, designed for the HellDigiset, a typesetting machine made by a German company, successfully accommodated the technologys limitations. Today, at 82, Mr. Zapf remains an innovator. ''Designing metal type faces was done under the technical limitations of the casting process,'' he said from Darmstadt, Germany, where he lives. ''The digital technology of today gives you freedom which you never had in the time of hot metal. But I dont use my Mac for designing types. I like to draw and to use my hand.'' Mr. Zapf's work is found in both Microsoft and Apple Macintosh systems. Macintosh operating systems include 18 fonts, three of which he has designed: ITC Zapf Chancery, ITC Zapf Dingbats and Palatino. Apple Computer's new operating system, due on March 24, will feature the latest Zapf font, a lilting script called Zapfino. A typical Microsoft Windows 2000 package includes eight typefaces, including his Palatino Linotype. Mr. Zapf's letters also appear in advertising for companies like Estee Lauder, on Hallmark cards and on the more than 58,000 names engraved in stone at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. An exhibit, ''The Fine Art of Letters: The Work of Hermann Zapf'' is on view until Saturday at the Grolier Club in Manhattan.

Now if all this had happened, say, five years ago, their conviction might have soon faded away. The couple might have told their friends or family about this secret dream of resurrecting their baby's genes, and been talked out of it, or comforted in some other way. But it happened last year -- four years into the cloning revolution sparked by Dolly the sheep, at a moment when optimism about the miracles of biotech was running high and when it was not at all hard to find other people who shared a kind of metaphysical faith in the power of genes.

Supermarket Pastoral Almost overnight, the amount and variety of organic food on offer in my local supermarket has mushroomed. Fresh produce, milk, eggs, cereal, frozen food, even junk food -- all of it now has its own organic doppelg* nger, and more often than not these products wind up in my shopping cart. I like buying organic, for the usual salad of rational and sentimental reasons. At a time when the whole food system feels somewhat precarious, I assume that a product labeled organic is more healthful and safer, more ''wholesome,'' though if I stop to think about it, I'm not exactly sure what that means. I also like the fact that by buying organic, I'm casting a vote for a more environmentally friendly kind of agriculture: ''Better Food for a Better Planet,'' in the slogan of Cascadian Farm, one of the older organic brands. Compared with all the other food in the supermarket, which is happy to tell you everything about itself except how it was grown, organic food seems a lot more legible. ''Organic'' on the label conjures a whole story, even if it is the consumer who fills in most of the details, supplying the hero (American Family Farmer), the villain (Agribusinessman) and the literary genre, which I think of as ''supermarket pastoral.'' Just look at the happy Vermont cow on that carton of milk, wreathed in wildflowers like a hippie at her wedding around 1973. Look a little closer, though, and you begin to see cracks in the pastoral narrative. It took me more than a year to notice, but the label on that carton of Organic Cow has been rewritten recently. It doesn't talk about happy cows and Vermont family farmers quite so much anymore, probably because the Organic Cow has been bought out by Horizon, a Colorado company (referred to here, in proper pastoral style, as ''the Horizon family of companies''). Horizon is a $127 million public corporation that has become the Microsoft of organic milk, controlling 70 percent of the retail market. Notice, too, that the milk is now ''ultrapasteurized,'' a process the carton presents as a boon to the consumer (it pushes the freshness date into the next millennium), but which of course also allows the company to ferry its milk all over the country.", "headline": {"main": "Naturally"}, "abstract": "Michael Pollan article on $7.7 billion organic food industry; notes many organic foods do not live up to his expectations of less processed, more local and easier on animals, with many now made by giant conglomerates; industry's rapid growth reflects consumers' rising worries about conventional food supply and has attracted takeovers by very agribusiness corporations often criticized in past by organic movement; direction of Cascadian Farms, industry pioneer that recently became General Mills unit, discussed; photos (L)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 8245, "_id": "4fd22ff78eb7c8105d7be540", "snippet": " 1.

Why do I often see the term '' '' in the messages I get from my Internet mailing list? What is it? A. That peculiar string of characters is actually a typographical sequence indicating a ''nonbreaking'' space. It is often used in HyperText Markup Language for putting a space between two words or elements on a Web page like one you would get by pressing the space bar while using a word-processing program, but it also tells the Web browser that is displaying the HTML code not to break the line of text there. HTML is not just for Web browsers anymore, however: many e-mail programs use it to display images and styled type within a message. In some programs, a double space or the pasting of text from a Web page into the e-mail message might create the code, but it is usually invisible to the sender with an HTML-enabled e-mail program. E-mail programs that can display messages only in plain text will present a screen of visible HTML codes like the   tag, but sometimes nothing at all. The odds are that the person sending or forwarding the message has his or her e-mail program set to send messages with formatting instead of as plain text, or that the distribution program used by the mail server is converting the messages to plain text and revealing the codes for all to see. Q. I have heard of RAM and ROM, but what kind of memory is flash memory? A. Unlike random-access memory (RAM), which stores data temporarily -- and loses it if you crash without saving your file -- flash memory can easily store information and not lose it when its power source is cut off. This may make flash memory seem more like the stable, permanent read-only memory (ROM). But unlike ROM, flash memory can store and delete new information. So, with its ability to write and erase new information and save it even if the electricity goes out, flash memory tends to be used as if it were a hard drive, for storing data. Although it cannot store as much data, flash memory has advantages over a hard drive in that it is lighter, faster and smaller and has no moving parts. It is, however, more expensive to produce. Flash memory turns up in all sorts of products. Some computer BIOS chips use it, as do memory cards for video game consoles, portable MP3 players and removable storage cards like Memory Sticks, Compact Flash and SmartMedia. Q. I am considering buying a scanner with which I can scan text into a Word file and tabular data into an Excel file. What software do I need to do this? A. If you want to scan paper documents into your computer so that you can edit them electronically, you should consider getting an optical character recognition, or O.C.R., program to work with your scanner. An O.C.R. program analyzes the characters printed on the page and converts them to a document on your computer so that you can edit the text. O.C.R. software is not infallible, however, and although some versions claim very high accuracy rates, several factors can affect the quality of the translation. Smudges or blurry type on the original document can cause the O.C.R. program to misread the text. Streaks or smears on the glass under the lid of the scanner can also interfere with accuracy. Good O.C.R. programs often provide a spelling-checker function so that you can locate and correct any errors. You can find such programs in online or retail software stores, and a version is often provided free with certain scanners. You should check the program's requirements and make sure it is compatible with your scanner hardware. ScanSoft makes a number of O.C.R. programs for Windows and Macintosh systems, including OmniPage Pro and TextBridge Pro Millennium. (The TextBridge program is advertised as working especially well with Microsoft Office programs like Word and Excel.) ABBYY offers another O.C.R. program, FineReader Pro 5.0, in versions for Mac and Windows systems. J. D.
