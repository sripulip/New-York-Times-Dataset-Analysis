Intel took issue with the finding and said it was considering how to respond. The commission said Intel used unfair business practices to persuade five Japanese personal computer makers, including Sony and Toshiba, to stop or limit their purchases of microprocessors from two Intel rivals, Advanced Micro Devices and the Transmeta Corporation. The action against Intel came 11 months after the commission began its investigation with a raid on the company's Japanese offices. Fair trade authorities said that since May 2002, Intel offered discounts and incentives to computer makers that were contingent on promises that those companies either cease, or strictly limit, purchases from other chip makers. Intel said in a statement that it regarded its practices as fair and lawful. The company has 10 days to decide whether to appeal. If it does, the case would go through the commission's judicial review process. ''There is a broad consensus that competition regulators should only intervene where there is evidence of harm to consumers,'' D. Bruce Sewell, Intel's vice president and general counsel, said in the statement. ''It is apparent the J.F.T.C.'s recommendation did not sufficiently weigh these important principles.'' The ruling, which does not carry a fine, was the second action by Japanese competition regulators against a major American high-technology company in the last year. In July, the commission ordered Microsoft to remove a clause in its licensing contracts that was intended to protect it from patent suits. Intel has about 90 percent of the Japanese market for microprocessors, with the remainder split between Advanced Micro and Transmeta. That compares with an 80 percent market share for Intel worldwide. In the ruling, regulators did not ask Intel to stop offering volume discounts or other incentives to computer makers, but it did order the company to stop tying those discounts to promises to stop buying rival brands. In one case, Intel forced a computer maker to buy all of its semiconductors from Intel or lose rebates that had been offered, the commission said without identifying the manufacturer. Regulators argued that Intel's sales methods were unfair because the stipulations virtually assured that computer companies would severely limit purchases from rivals. Intel's brand power with consumers and its overwhelming market share in Japan mean computer makers have little choice but to buy a large number of their chips from Intel, and losing the discounts on those purchases would be costly, they said. The commission determined that Intel's practice limited competition and thus was likely to drive up the cost of computers for consumers, said Hiroshi Yamada, a commission official who briefed reporters on the decision. ''The company urged the five computer makers not to buy products from rivals in order to raise its own market share,'' Mr. Yamada said. The combined Japanese market share of A.M.D. and Transmeta dropped by more than half from 24 percent in 2002 to 11 percent in 2003, the commission said. Intel accounted for the remainder of the market, so its share rose to 89 percent from 76 percent in the period. A.M.D. has cited Intel's sales practices for its dwindling market share in Japan and applauded the ruling. ''It's a clear determination by the F.T.C. that Intel has been abusing a dominant position to limit competition,'' Thomas M. McCoy, executive vice president for legal affairs at A.M.D., said in an interview here.", "headline": {"main": "Japan Says Intel Violated Antimonopoly Law", "kicker": "TECHNOLOGY"}, "abstract": "Fair Trade Commission in Japan rules that Intel Corp violated country's antimonopoly law in way it sold semiconductors and orders company to step some of its sales practices; Intel takes issue with finding and says it is considering how to respond; commission says Intel used unfair business practices to persuade five Japanese personal computer makers, including Sony and Toshiba, to stop or limit their purchases of microprocessors from Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta Corp (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 591, "_id": "4fd25ae68eb7c8105d8078b1", "snippet": "The Fair Trade Commission in Japan ruled on Tuesday that Intel violated the country's antimonopoly law in the way it sold semiconductors.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09intel.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "JAPAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "INTEL CORP"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRANSMETA CORP"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TOSHIBA CORP"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FAIR TRADE COMMISSION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "INTEL CORPORATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SONY CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SALES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER CHIPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND LAWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Todd", "lastname": "ZAUN"}], "original": "By TODD ZAUN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-03-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Business"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Circuits", "lead_paragraph": "THE story of a technological advance created in a garage by an amateur tinkerer is so common that it has become a clich\u00e9.

Ong, a graphic designer, reworked a pair of white Air Force 1's with a safari-print graphic treatment adapted from a different Nike model, and he won.

SBTG is not the first sneakerhead to, in effect, go pro. The most famous customizer is probably the Los Angeles-based artist who works under the name Methamphibian, whose shoes (or kicks, as they say) can go for $900 a pair and who is now designing sneakers that are scheduled to be produced by DC Shoes, which makes skateboarding shoes and apparel.

In this flat new world, there is a level (or at least more level) playing field in which countries like India and China, long marginalized in the global economy, are able to compete.

America is still the global leader in science and technology, but its dominance is eroding. As Mr. Friedman points out in ''The World Is Flat,'' Asian countries now produce eight times as many bachelor's degrees in engineering as the United States; the proportion of foreign-born Ph.D.'s in the American science and engineering labor force has risen to 38 percent; and federal financing for research in physical and mathematical sciences and engineering as a share of gross domestic product declined by 37 percent from 1970 to 2004.", "headline": {"main": "Global Playing Field: More Level, but It Still Has Bumps", "kicker": "BOOKS OF THE TIMES"}, "abstract": "Joseph E Stiglitz reviews book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the 21st Century by Thomas L Friedman; photo (M)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 1029, "_id": "4fd2460f8eb7c8105d7e122f", "snippet": "The world is flat, or at least becoming flatter very quickly, Thomas L.

But for these artists and critics, it's a personal landmark. Here's how it affected them. SARAH JESSICA PARKER, Actress When I was first in ''Annie'' on Broadway -- that was 1978 -- there was a great line in the show: ''You'll stay up until this floor shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.'' That was my first real image, how it sparkled in the skyline. When my husband and I were courting, we used to walk everywhere, from Battery Park to the Chrysler Building, and we went into the lobby, quite late at night, many, many times -- summer nights and cold nights. That magnificent lobby, a far superior lobby to the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building symbolized what I think we wanted in coming to New York: to be New Yorkers and to thrive in the city. The Chrysler Building was this magnificent piece of art. It was a sand castle. You could imagine that the sand was wet, and you were shaping it with your fingers. MATTHEW BARNEY, artist and filmmaker Wrote, directed and acted in the ''Cremaster'' film series. I spoke with Jerry Speyer and his daughter, Valerie Speyer Peltier, about ''Cremaster 3,'' and they very graciously granted me permission to shoot in the elevator car interiors, the staircase between the arcade level and the lobby and most significantly the floors beneath the finial. The maypole scene was shot in that space, as well as the final murder scene between the architect and the apprentice. The building would catch my eye from its numerous sightlines. I felt like it was laughing at me for the numerous small failures during the production. Now I've come to terms with the building. It feels like an ex-girlfriend. ROBERT A.M. STERN, architect Dean of the Yale School of Architecture; an author of a book series that began with ''New York 1900'' and will include ''New York 2000,'' to be published next year. I was a Brooklyn boy, about 7, 8 or 9. It was the late 40's, and Dad takes young lad to see the cars. The Chrysler cars were still being displayed in great, glamorous, dark showrooms, in curved-glass windows, which were recessed so that there would be no reflection on the glass. You would look inside, and there was a car that turned around. The Chrysler Building caught the exuberance and the spirit of the 1920's in a way that no other building in the world has. That's what we love: its swagger and originality. We live in a timid age in comparison. The critics didn't like it, to which I say boo on the critics. You know that old song ''Ain't We Got Fun?'' I don't think critics had fun. The Depression derailed a lot of architects. Chrysler built it, and he had the showrooms in it, he embellished the outside with symbols that were explicit with his hubcaps, his radiator hood ornaments, and when Chrysler moved out, Texaco moved in. And they couldn't change the name of the building to Texaco. It's Chrysler inside and out. We don't have buildings today that express the identity of the client, like Saarinen did with the T.W.A. building. I want to save the Edward Durell Stone building. It is what it is. It's history. The ideas of Huntington Hartford and the ideas of Mr. Stone were united. In the 1990's, Walt Disney was building the animation building in Burbank, for which I was the architect. I took courage and inspiration from many things, not the least of which was the swagger and iconographic self-confidence of the Chrysler Building. RON CHERNOW, author Wrote ''Alexander Hamilton'' (Penguin Press, 2004) and ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' (Random House, 1998) As a teenager growing up in Queens, the Chrysler Building was one of those Art Deco skyscrapers shimmering on the Manhattan skyline, beckoning people from the outer boroughs. I've always been torn as to which is my favorite skyscraper, the Empire State or the Chrysler Building. It's a hard decision, because the Empire State has this elegant poise and majestic air of calm and beauty. The Chrysler Building has a different silhouette. It's jazzy and electric and jagged, the beautiful but brash cousin. The Empire State Building expresses the daytime personality of the city: power and business. The Chrysler Building appeals to the night, to the fantasy life of the city in its glitz and glamour. What's fascinating and consistent about the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building is that they were conceived during the giddiest part of the 1920's boom and were completed during the bust, and they embody the dizzying hopes of the 1920's and reflect the dismal reality of the 1930's, the Depression and the collapse of the Manhattan real estate market. Automobile ownership tripled in the 1920's, so auto stocks were to the stock market what Intel and Microsoft were to the boom of the 1990's. If someone said what kind of company built that building, you'd say, ''Oh my god, it was a car company.'' It was a time when the car claimed the American imagination, and it was land transport soaring off into the clouds. STEPHEN BENNETT PHILLIPS A curator at the Phillips Collection; organized the traveling exhibition ''Margaret Bourke-White: The Photography of Design, 1927-1936.'' Bourke-White, when she was in Cleveland, became a well-known industrial photographer. The Chrysler Corporation got to know her, and they hired her to photograph the final construction of the building from 1929 to 1930. She was on scaffolding and on towers about 800 feet off the ground. It got windy, and the scaffolding swayed from side to side. The assignment gave her the idea that she wanted to live in the Chrysler Building: she wanted the best address. At the same time Henry Luce had hired her to be the photographer for Fortune magazine. The only person who can live in the building is the janitor. She had such chutzpah, she applied for the job as janitor. She finds that the job has been filled by someone else, so she had to live someplace else and could only have her studio in the Chrysler Building. Bourke-White doesn't want just any apartment there. She wants the 61st floor, the terrace where two of the gargoyles are. She is a woman photographer, and there was a bias about that, that she'd get married, have a baby, quit a job. Fortune wouldn't rent her the space on her own, even though she was making tens of thousands of dollars. Her lease had to be cosigned by Time Inc. Isn't that amazing? She paid $387.92 per month, plus electricity -- that was a lot of money back then -- and hires her good friend, John Vassos, an industrial designer, to create an Art Moderne stylish interior, with extensive built-ins, subdued palette, woods and metals. There was a main sitting area, an alcove for her desk, stairs that go out to the terrace. The superintendent reminded Bourke-White that her lease did not include access to the terrace, and she wrote back, ''Of course.'' But she invited businessmen whom she wanted to befriend to have cocktails on the terrace. Bourke-White's early interest in college and high school was herpetology: snakes, turtles. She had a fish tank in her studio and lots of creatures. Some friends coming back from Florida brought her two pet alligators, which she kept on the terrace. She had an aluminum pond constructed there. By 1932, the Depression was hitting hard, Fortune magazine is cutting back on what they're paying photographers and she's falling behind in her rent. In 1934 she falls very far behind, owing $6,000, and is evicted. She found cheaper studio space on 521 Fifth Avenue. The alligators got fairly large, but she took them with her. ADA LOUISE HUXTABLE Architecture critic, The Wall Street Journal. I was born in Manhattan, and I was always aware of the Chrysler Building as part of the New York landscape. I just accepted it. It wasn't until I was at the Museum of Modern Art, where I was assistant curator of architecture while I was still in graduate school, that I learned there was a split, a line drawn depending on whether you accepted the Chrysler Building as a good example of Modernism. That was the late 1940's, and Modernism, as it was being exhibited and promoted by the Museum of Modern Art, was based on a functionalist aesthetic. And the Chrysler Building is not a functional aesthetic. It's a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic, a lot more to do with Deco. But it was considered out of bounds by the Museum of Modern Art, an aberration. I think it's magnificent. Anybody in his right mind loves that building. PAUL GOLDBERGER Dean, Parsons School of Design, and architecture critic for the New Yorker. I grew up in the suburbs, and I just remember seeing it from afar for a long time, not going into it. And then going into its magical lobby. The lobby has this compressed, intense energy: the dark red-orange marble, and the way the space works as a funnel, pushing you through. It's not a grandiose experience, it's not like Radio City Hall, but it has this concentrated density that's amazing. The elevators are magnificent. Each is a different pattern of wood inlay, so it's like a fugue, a whole series of variations on a theme. The view is magical, but the sad thing about the view is that it doesn't include the Chrysler Building. ALEXANDROS WASHBURN, architect Staff member to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 1994 to 1996; president of Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, 1996 to 2000. In 1996, for eight months, he worked in Moynihan's New York headquarters on the 62nd floor. In Washington's terms, people thought I was nuts to leave the heart of power, but the office was in the Chrysler Building. The rent was low, $31 a square foot, or 5,000 square feet for $150,000 a year. It was at the level of the stainless steel eagle. I had an office in the southeast corner of the 62nd floor. My office was huge, 1,000 square feet. Senator Moynihan had the office that had the southern exposure, in the center of the building, the pair of windows looking due south over the entire Manhattan. He had Shaker furniture and a chair from the Nixon White House that said ''Counselor to the President.'' His social routine was he'd fly in to La Guardia in the morning; we'd pick him up at the La Guardia shuttle and drive him in to the Chrysler Building, give him the morning papers, and he'd attend to his memos and write a little. You had to have read all the papers, cover to cover, word for word. You'd expect his call at 9:15 a.m., and you'd have a morning of madness, demanding memos, and get me Mr. Secretary of the Treasury, and get me the mayor, and then there'd be the blessed lunch at Bemelmans at the Carlyle. He was religious about lunch. I'd always have the turkey sandwich, and he preferred the club sandwich. It was a two-hour lunch. He would always have a glass of Pouilly Fuiss\u00e9 or two, and I drank, too, and that was what the couch was for. His evening event would likely be outside the office, and you'd coordinate that. At around 7:30, the signal you waited for was, ''Wheels are up,'' and he was back on the plane to Washington, and that was the magic moment of release from responsibility. Wheels up, Scotch out and sun down. What you recognize in New York, as you look north and south, is the alternating red and white of the avenues, taillights and headlights, these rivers of white and red, and a blue twilight, spread out like an American flag. At twilight, I'd get out a drink of Scotch, get out my sketchbook and sketch the panorama outside, this lovely moody sweep, so detached. Each day, you take the subway in, this slow apotheosis, dripping from grime with the rush hour, and there was this release as you climbed up these black terrazzo stairs and entered the lobby. But it hadn't been renovated yet, so it had a 1930's film of grime on it. It was blessed with neglect, because sometimes the worst crimes of architecture are done under the justification of modernization. In the Chrysler Building, these are the same elevators, the same buttons, the same doors since 1930. The same tracery, the same laid wood that a nervous speak-easy patron would run his hand over. And slow, so slow. It was like going up in a balloon ride. We were on the 62nd floor. The round trip from the 62nd floor downstairs to coffee outside and back up would take 30 minutes. When you arrived on the 62nd floor, there was an extreme letdown. Inside, it was government issue: more Dick Tracy than Jimmy Walker. Drywall walls. In D.C. there's a chandelier, a window opening to the Capitol dome behind, velvet senatorial curtains, double swags, stars, a building designed for senators from the inside out. The Chrysler Building was designed for the city. I was thrilled to be there. It was like having an office in the Acropolis. When we went to rent it, we asked, What's upstairs? The office manager said: ''It's the Cloud Club. It's closed, and nobody goes there.'' He eventually climbed up there and opened the door, where the stainless steel panels begin to arch. It was a speak-easy, and the first thing you notice are these carved wood cupboards with pictograms on it, and each person would keep their stash of contraband spirits there and wouldn't want it identified by name, so they identified it with pictograms, stylized angular letters. A little door would open, you gave the password and you said you wanted a double Scotch fast. The architecture and the panorama are meant to be married, and this is one of the most powerful rooms in New York. This should have been Giuliani's office. The reason the Cloud Club wasn't being used then was that the access was too difficult; the fire stairs would have to be enlarged. I would counter it was never meant to be a public space. It was meant to be an elitist space, and the fewer people up there the better. It had the feeling of an eagle's perch carved inside of a cliff, and it was dusty. There was the debris of chalky plaster on the floor. It was an abandoned place, and it didn't lessen its power. If anything, it heightened the romance. CARL SPIELVOGEL Chairman, Carl Spielvogel Enterprises, a global investment manager; former chairman, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, which rented Floors 12 to 24 from 1983 to 1995. There was never a day when I walked into the building that I didn't have what I call a rush. There were people in the lobby looking at the ceiling, the history of flight. And it was a great feeling getting into an elevator, as opposed to going into something that looked like you were getting into a hospital elevator. They're patterned wood and metal. Now you get into an elevator, and there's a television commercial. JIMMY BRESLIN Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and onetime candidate for New York City Council president. I come from Queens. We do better with low density out there, but I've been in it. It's nice. With what's around now, straight-up-and-down glass boxes, the architecture is absolutely abominable in New York now. I love graceful buildings, and I loved the skyline before it was mangled and distorted. But the Chrysler is not my favorite building. The Flatiron Building, a hundred to nothing over the Chrysler. I like the shape of it. I like the grit downtown, street after street of five-story buildings with bars and stores and schools and fire engines and barber shops. That makes the city, the life. THEODORE PRUDON Architect at Prudon & Partners; helped restore the exterior of the Chrysler Building in the early 1980's. The eagle gargoyles are an early example of stainless steel in America. Chrysler and the Empire State Building were two early examples to use it. The finish was slightly dulled after 50 years, so we buffed it, and wherever necessary the seams got repaired. There was very little work on the spire; it was in good condition. What got put in at the time was the lighting, the strip lights that outline the triangles in the windows. You can see thin fluorescents that follow the outlines of the windows, which give it the festive appearance. After the energy crisis of the 1970's, when all buildings were dark, this was a way of relighting buildings that was both energy-efficient and beautiful. DOROTHY TWINING GLOBUS Curator of exhibitions, Museum of Arts and Design. This was 1969. My father had an office in the Chrysler Building. He was undercover with the C.I.A. I came up from Swarthmore one day to meet him for dinner. I was supposed to meet him at the Chrysler Building.

Even one of its producers, the superstar Will Smith, calls the movie ''perfectly bizarre'' in its twists, on-screen and off. Indeed, ''Saving Face'' owes its existence to the vagaries of business planning at Microsoft, to new assertiveness in the Chinese-American film world, and to a helicopter soaring above Manhattan for the $70 million Sony Pictures blockbuster ''Hitch.''

(His colleague Bill Gates owns the compound next door.) Mr. Raikes bought the beloved but run-down resort in 2001. Since it first opened in 1913, Alderbrook has been a vacation spot for Seattle and Tacoma families. The resort's face lift, by the Seattle architect Dan Foltz, is neo-Craftsman. Its materials, colors and detailing inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, the turn-of-the-century school of design that emphasized simplicity and natural materials. In the lobby, a stone fireplace reaches to the 30-foot-high ceiling, 20 peeled logs support the beams and the huge windows overlook the natural, Northwest-style landscaped courtyard and the canal beyond. Alderbrook has a gabled roof, lots of wood and stone, and shades of brown and green that blend with the resort's forested and mountainous environment. But it's a Northwest vacation lodge with big-city amenities, including a full-service spa, a 55-foot heated glass-enclosed swimming pool, and a whirlpool. Guests receive preferred tee times at the neighboring 18-hole Alderbrook Golf and Yacht Club. The Restaurant at Alderbrook (run by Tom Black, an award-winning chef) serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. THE LOCATION -- Alderbrook is just down State Road 106 past Union (pop. 345) on the 70-mile-long Puget Sound inlet known as the Hood Canal. It's about two hours by ferry and car from Seattle, about 20 minutes by seaplane. In Union and at the resort, you can rent a kayak from Kayak Hood Canal (www.kayakhoodcanal.com) for a closer look at the canal's harbor seals, bald eagles, ospreys, great blue herons, otters and salmon. THE ROOMS -- All 77 rooms have cozy window seats and balconies or patios for enjoying views either of the canal or of the Olympic Mountains to the west. Each room also offers free high-speed Internet access, down comforters and French press coffee. Framed photos from Alderbrook family vacations of yore, provided by guests, hang on the walls. The 15 remodeled cottages, arranged in a horseshoe next to the lodge, have one or two bedrooms, fireplaces and fully furnished kitchens. Grocery delivery from the lodge can be arranged. THE BATHROOMS -- Green-tiled walls surround deep and roomy oval soaking tubs. There are large showers, with dispensers of Molton Brown bath products. THE CROWD -- On a sunny summer afternoon last year, a group of people in their 20's played badminton on the lawn and a family frolicked in the pool as an elderly couple sipped wine in Adirondack chairs and watched kayakers paddle by. Sometimes, celebrities visiting Mr. Gates dine in the two-tiered restaurant with its spectacular water view. ROOM SERVICE -- Selections from the restaurant's breakfast, lunch and dinner menus are available, but room service ends at 9 p.m. The menu is seasonal and features local produce and seafood. Popular choices are oyster po' boy sandwich ($10), Dungeness crab macaroni and cheese ($12), and Hood Canal cioppino ($22), made with local clams, mussels, oysters, salmon and prawns. THE BOTTOM LINE -- Alderbrook had a perfect location when its renovation began. Now it's a luxurious, yet remote, getaway. Summer season room rates begin at $160 a person, double occupancy, for a room with limited views; a marina-view suite goes for up to $310. Cottages start at $180; a two-bedroom waterfront cottage costs as much as $450.

Two years later, there he was on the cover of Time, sitting barefoot on a golden throne, dressed in jeans and a rumpled black polo. The magazine cast him as the king of the ''golden geeks,'' a group that popularized the formerly novel notion of surfing the Web and, not incidentally, helped create a vision of Silicon Valley as a glittering gold field where the young, bright and vigorous could stake a claim and make themselves unimaginably wealthy before they even had the time to put up posters in their barely furnished apartments. The baby fat has melted from the face of Andreessen; now 33, he is tall and almost slim, with short hair, and he dresses more like a grown-up (crisp white dress shirt, brass-buttoned black blazer). America Online bought Netscape for $4 billion in stock in 1998, and Andreessen left to start a company called Loudcloud, which went public in 2001; he serves as its chairman (the company was renamed Opsware in 2002). Several years back, Fortune pegged Andreessen's net worth at roughly $500 million, but with a wink and a playful dance of his eyebrows he implies that he's worth much more than that. Still, he continues to fill up notebooks with ideas and sketched-out business plans for new companies.

With an average price around $35, games cost more than many books, CD's, museum-admission and movie tickets, so they are often purchased as a gift (though probably as often for one's own self). Though some major games are released while it is still nice outside -- Battlefield 2 hit shelves this summer -- the death of arcade gaming has largely pushed the pastime indoors. And so, most publishers now release their top games when the weather outside turns frightful. In 2004, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas came out in late October and still was the best-selling game of the year. But while many gamers knew that San Andreas and Halo 2 would be large hits last year, the industry is worried that there are no obvious blockbusters this fall. In fact, two games that were expected to be major draws this coming holiday season -- The Godfather, from Electronic Arts, and Nintendo's latest Zelda -- have recently been delayed into 2006.

But the bigger part was that Group O Direct, though it had been around since 1974, did not know how to navigate corporate shoals. Then, in 2001, SBC Communications, seeking more minority vendors, took Group O Direct, in Milan, Ill., under its wing. ''They led us through their procurement process, what certifications we needed, how to write a bid, who to contact, how to set prices,'' Mr. De La Cruz said.

Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, said late Thursday that third-quarter inome from continuing operations should be between 27 cents and 31 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting a 43 cent-per-share profit when Alcoa announces financial results on Oct. 10. Alcoa blamed lower aluminum prices and higher costs, particularly in energy and raw materials. Seasonal weakness in Europe and automotive markets also hurt business. Alcoa also said Hurricane Rita's impact would hurt third-quarter results. The company, based in Pittsburgh, was forced to close its Point Comfort, Tex., alumina refinery and the Lake Charles, La., anode plant because of the hurricane. (AP) Goodyear to Close Plants With High Costs The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company said yesterday it would close an undisclosed number of plants as part of a restructuring aimed at improving its North American tire business and saving up to $1 billion over the next three years. The company did not say how many jobs would be affected, how many plants would be closed or their locations. But it did say it would focus the cuts on high-cost plants and increase sourcing from Asia as it seeks other ways to increase productivity while introducing new products. Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio, said it planned to cut high-cost capacity between 8 percent and 12 percent, generating annual savings of $100 million to $150 million. The company said it would record restructuring charges of between $150 million and $250 million over the next three years. (AP) Huffy to Emerge From Bankruptcy as Private Company The Huffy Corporation, a maker of bicycles for more than 75 years, won court approval of a plan to exit bankruptcy and repay creditors by giving its stock to a Chinese government agency, suppliers and unsecured creditors. Huffy expects to end its bankruptcy case in October, the company said. All of the company's equity will be canceled and Huffy will no longer be publicly traded. John Muskovich, Huffy's chief executive, said the company would focus on bicycles and golf equipment. Huffy is based in Miamisburg, Ohio. (Bloomberg News) Microsoft Eases Rules to Oust Directors The Microsoft Corporation revised its rules to make it easier for shareholders to force directors off the board. Directors who receive a majority of ''withhold'' votes in an uncontested election will be asked to resign, the company said yesterday. The company also declared a dividend of 8 cents a share, payable on Dec. 8. The change is an attempt by Microsoft to improve corporate governance. ''Today's decision gives shareholders a greater voice in the process for selecting directors,'' Bill Gates, chairman, said in the statement. Microsoft is based in Redmond, Wash. (Bloomberg News) ConAgra to Keep Retiring Executive on Payroll ConAgra Foods said yesterday it would pay Bruce Rohde $50,000 a month for four years after he resigns as chief executive on Sept. 30. Rohde will continue to receive health and other benefits during that period, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Rohde, 56, will be succeeded by a former PepsiCo executive, Gary Rodkin, on Oct. 1. Mr. Rohde was paid $1.24 million in the fiscal year ending in May, an 88 percent cut from the previous year, as ConAgra net income fell 21 percent to $641.5 million. Stock in the company, which is based in Omaha, has fallen 32 percent since he took over in September 1997. (Bloomberg News) New Step in Resolving Aircraft Subsidy Dispute The European Union and the United States took a fresh step yesterday in their dispute over subsidies for their airplane makers, agreeing to name a senior Mexican trade official to gather information on financial support they may have provided to the rivals Airbus and the Boeing Company. They agreed to appoint Mateo Diego-Fernandez to oversee the process, which involves collecting data on markets and similar companies from other World Trade Organization members. The information will be used to assess the Airbus and Boeing subsidies. The W.T.O. set up legal panels two months ago to investigate cases brought by the two trade powers, which accuse each other of illegally subsidizing the aircraft makers. (AP) ACE Aviation Holdings , the owner of Air Canada, said it reached an agreement with its pilots union that might allow the carrier to renegotiate an aircraft order with the Boeing Company. The Air Canada Pilots Association, which represents 3,100 pilots, agreed to a binding arbitration process that gives the airline ''certainty on pilot costs,'' Air Canada said. In June, the pilots rejected a contract with Air Canada to fly new Boeing jets, a move that forced ACE to cancel a $6.1 billion plane order for 18 Boeing 777s and 14 787 Dreamliners. An agreement with pilots would allow ACE to approach Boeing for another order. (Bloomberg News) The Walt Disney Company will record a cost of $68 million for airplane leases after Delta Air Lines declared bankruptcy, erasing the investments. The full $101 million value of the leases is impaired, Disney said yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. No amount of the impairment represents a cash cost, Disney said. (Bloomberg News) The Boeing Company hired a former Air Force General, Craig Cooning, as general manager of its space and intelligence unit to help oversee projects including spy satellites. Mr. Cooning, who retired from the Air Force three weeks ago, will be in charge of staffing, technology development, quality control and day to day operations at the unit, including the top-secret Future Imagery Architecture project, a spokeswoman, Marta Newhart, said yesterday. (Bloomberg News) Swedish Insurer's Board Opposes Takeover Bid The board of the Swedish insurer Forsakrings AB Skandia advised its shareholders yesterday to reject a 44.9 billion kronor ($6.02 billion) takeover bid by the South African financial services group Old Mutual PLC. Old Mutual said it would proceed with the offer. A split Skandia board said Old Mutual's bid was too low.

Jobs, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was back last week to introduce an iPod that can play video. Behind the News -- The bells and whistles of an Apple product unveiling are never to be ignored, but this time it was wedding bells: iPod and television are the happy couple. The new device can shop online for episodes from some ABC and Disney Channel shows, including from the night before, for about $2 a pop. The move comes after two years of Mr. Jobs's saying that nobody would watch a movie on a two-inch screen. TO BOSTON WE GO The News -- JetBlue said Tuesday that next month it would introduce 10 daily flights between New York and Boston. Behind the News -- It's the kind of airfare that could almost make a Yankee fan want to go into enemy territory: $25 one way, for tickets bought by this Thursday. Thereafter the flight will cost $40 to $120. But the route has long been dominated by the traditional major carriers, and they were not without an answer for JetBlue's latest nudging onto their turf. The next day American Airlines began offering $25 tickets on the same route, and Delta introduced a $40 fare. Take that, rookie. THE FOOT-WIDE JOURNAL The News -- The Wall Street Journal plans to shrink by about the width of the 'Street' in its banner. Behind the News -- The measure comes on the heels of The Journal's plan to shrink its international edition to tabloid size, starting next month. Both moves are in part a response to the increase in the cost of newsprint, an industrywide concern that has led other papers to similar decisions. Making The Journal smaller is expected to save its owner, Dow Jones, about $18 million a year. The company has said that it expected the smaller size to be more appealing to readers. ANOTHER GOOD THING? The News -- Martha Stewart is taking on a new partner, the housing developer KB Homes. The deal calls for a subdivision in Cary, N.C., to incorporate the style of Ms. Stewart's own homes into its 650 houses. Behind the News -- Before anyone who wants to live like Martha packs up the free-range chickens and heads to Cary, there are one or two questions to consider: one, is the housing industry heading into a downturn, and two, is Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose stock has fallen since March, diluting its brand as it branches into areas like satellite radio and music producing? YOU'VE GOT AOL! The News -- AOL.com has positioned itself as a free Web portal in recent months, with much of the content that used to be available only to subscribers now open to everyone. Last week, Time Warner, AOL's parent, officially unveiled the advertising campaign for it (at a cost estimated at $50 million). Behind the News -- The paying user continues to flee AOL, but Web sites that are part of it -- Moviefone, Mapquest, Netscape -- are a draw. That appeal may be behind talks between Time Warner and others regarding potential investments in AOL. Microsoft, Google, Comcast and Yahoo have been named as suitors or potential suitors.", "headline": {"main": "New Routes | Oct. 9-15", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 554, "_id": "4fd24d6c8eb7c8105d7ee44d", "snippet": " APPLE EVERY OTHER DAY    The News -- Scarcely a month after Apple introduced its thinnest iPod, Steven P.

And so, the video iPod. And with it, Mr. Jobs's particularly clever coup: sealing a deal with his quasi-estranged partner, the Walt Disney Company, to distribute downloaded versions of such hit Disney-produced shows as ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost'' on the new gizmo, at $1.99 each.

Time Inc., a division of Time Warner, the world's largest media company, is expected to announce today that John Huey, 57, will succeed Norman Pearlstine, 63, on Jan. 1 to oversee the company's 155 magazines.

The host of the gathering, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, right, hopes progress can be made in balancing Britain's proposal to scale back farm subsidies that benefit countries like France with French and German demands for a reduction in Britain's annual budget rebate. DOWN TO THE WIRE -- Europe's protectionist agricultural policy -- not just its $50 billion in subsidies to farmers but also its high tariffs on imports -- is creating quite a trans-Atlantic row. The United States says Europe's refusal to bend is threatening the future of world trade talks, scheduled to resume in Hong Kong in December. Developing countries want both the United States and Europe to open their markets wider, and Washington is proposing steeper reductions in subsidies and tariffs than capitals like Paris are prepared to accept. The European Community is expected to come up with a revised offer later this week. HIGH-TECH TRAVEL -- Starting Wednesday, all passports issued by the 27 countries participating in the United States Visa Waiver Program, which allows business travelers and tourists to enter the country for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, must display a digital photo of the holder. Passports produced before then are still valid, however. FEAR VERSUS GREED -- For investors spooked by both inflation fears and the prospect of a housing market correction, clarification on whether to buy or sell is on the way. Figures for last month's sales of existing homes are due out tomorrow and for new homes on Thursday, while the latest store sales, plus two consumer-confidence indexes, will be reported tomorrow. Durable-goods orders for September will be reported on Thursday. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers come out Friday. SLOWING DOWN -- Earnings reports will ease a little from last week's pace; many companies will report results but fewer big names are among them.

Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Which American business sectors are feeling the effects of a poor international image? A. Inbound travel from other countries is off at least 1.5 percent, in terms of market share, from 2000 levels. One share point is 7.6 million visits and $12 billion in sales, because people who visit from other countries tend to stay longer and spend more. That's the equivalent of 153,000 jobs and lots of tax dollars. Q. Which chief executives are feeling that impact? A. No C.E.O. is willing to say the bottom line is hurting. But we have research that shows intention. For example, we know that 37 percent of the British intelligentsia say they will avoid buying U.S. brands because of the ''cultural identity'' of the United States. We know that in Group of 8 countries, 18 percent of the population claim they are avoiding American brands, with the top brand being Marlboro in terms of avoidance. Barbie is another one. McDonald's is another. There is a cooling toward American culture generally across the globe. Q. Is the war in Iraq driving the negativity? A. That's one of four root causes. Another is the arrogance, ignorance and insensitivity of American people. A third reason for anti-American sentiment is the pervasiveness of American pop culture. We're not the only source of ''cool'' anymore. And the fourth reason is the effects of globalization. In developing countries, they resent the fact that American-led globalization has, in their minds, left them out.", "headline": {"main": "Erasing the Image Of the Ugly American", "kicker": "OFFICE SPACE: ARMCHAIR M.B.A."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 883, "_id": "4fd2510a8eb7c8105d7f4f0d", "snippet": "How anti-U.S. sentiment isn't just unpleasant.

(Dow Jones/AP) Judge Refuses to Become Involved in Google Case A federal judge has rebuffed an attempt by Google Inc. to remove court-ordered restrictions limiting its employment of the computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee, whose recent defection from Microsoft exposed tensions between the companies. In a ruling late Thursday, Federal District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose, Calif., declined to become involved in the legal battle over Mr. Lee until the completion of a Washington State trial on the validity of a noncompete agreement Mr. Lee signed when he joined Microsoft in 2000. The Washington trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 9. (AP) Profits Decline at Archer Daniels Midland Shares of the Archer Daniels Midland Company rose yesterday despite a 30 percent decline in first-quarter earnings from sluggish grain sales because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Much of the profit decline was attributed to the agricultural services unit, which was disrupted by the storms. The largest business segments, including corn and oilseed processing, showed solid profit growth. Net income was $186.3 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $266.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 33 cents a share. Sales dropped 4 percent, to $8.63 billion, below analysts' estimates of $9.08 billion. (AP) No Accord, F.C.C. to Meet Again on 2 Takeover Deals Federal regulators failed to reach agreement yesterday on whether to approve the takeover of AT&T by SBC Communications and the purchase of MCI by Verizon Communications. The Federal Communications Commission met through the day but could not agree on what conditions, if any, should be attached to the deals. Another meeting was set for Monday. The negotiations come a day after the Justice Department gave its blessing to the acquisitions, with limited conditions. (AP) AirTran Decides Not to Sell Tickets on Expedia AirTran Holdings Inc., parent of AirTran Airways, said yesterday that it would no longer make its inventory and fares available for sale with Expedia Inc., which runs the online travel agency Expedia.com. The low-cost carrier also said it had entered a multiyear deal with the Cendant Corporation to sell tickets through its Apollo and Galileo travel sites. (Reuters) S.E.C.

Mr. Ricciardi, 52, who is head of the S.E.C.'s Boston office, will manage and track the workload. They will replace succeed Thomsen, who was named director in May. (Bloomberg News) Profit Soars 46% at Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said yesterday that third-quarter profit increased 46 percent after a surge in trading revenue and the highest fees from underwriting and giving mergers advice in almost three years. Net income rose to 991 million euros ($1.2 billion), or 1.89 euros a share, from 680 million euros, or 1.28 euros. Analysts had expected profit of 839 million euros. Revenue gained 31 percent, to 6.62 billion euros. (Bloomberg News) Matsushita Electric Reports Higher Income on Strong Sales The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese maker of Panasonic electronics, said yesterday that its profit surged 33 percent for the July-September quarter, lifted by strong sales of flat-panel TVs, digital cameras and personal computers. The Osaka-based company said profit was 31 billion yen ($268 million) in the second quarter, up from 23 billion yen in the period a year earlier. Sales were unchanged at 2.2 trillion yen ($19 billion).

In a letter mailed to shareholders, the company said Mr. Zucker's offer ''does not reflect the underlying value of Hudson's Bay business.'' The retailer said it had granted access to its corporate books to a number of other potential bidders, and that discussions were in progress. Analysts said the company's rejection was not a surprise, but they did not expect to see many counterbids emerging. The Canadian retailer, which operates more than 550 stores under the Bay, Zellers, and Home Outfitters names, reported its third quarterly loss on Thursday, hit by declining sales and a restructuring charge. (Reuters) Swiss Plan to Block Company's Acquisition of Eircom The Swiss government plans to block any foreign acquisitions by Swisscom, casting doubt on efforts by the country's largest phone company to buy Eircom Group of Ireland. The Swiss government, which owns 66 percent of Swisscom, ''isn't ready to take the risks'' and ''will block foreign engagements'' as long as it holds a majority stake in the company, Dieter Leutwyler, a Finance Ministry spokesman, said yesterday. A Swisscom spokeswoman, Pia Colombo, declined to comment whether the company will continue or break off talks with Eircom. An Eircom spokeswoman, Nuala Buttner, also declined to comment. (Bloomberg News) Chief Says Barrick Bid for Placer Dome Is Too Low Some shareholders of Placer Dome, the gold mining company, think the unsolicited $9.2 billion takeover offer from the Barrick Gold Corporation is too low, Placer Dome's chief executive said yesterday after meeting with investors. ''Clearly there's a high likelihood of a higher bid from Barrick because certainly the one they have on the table now is totally inadequate,'' the chief executive, Peter W. Tomsett said. (Reuters) Black Calls Charges a 'Massive Smear Job' The former newspaper magnate Conrad M. Black yesterday derided fraud charges against him as a ''massive smear job'' and vowed to be vindicated of accusations he looted millions of dollars from Hollinger International. His comments came after he failed to show up for an arraignment Tuesday in a federal court in Chicago. The court granted him an additional eight days to appear. ''There's no truth or substance whatsoever to these charges,'' Lord Black, left, said. ''This has been one massive smear job from A to Z, and it will have a surprise ending,'' he said, adding that he expected to be completely vindicated. Lord Black, 61, faces charges he defrauded the Hollinger International publishing empire he formerly controlled. (AP) Xbox Buyers Report Problems With New Console Microsoft, the world's software maker, said yesterday that it had received isolated reports of problems with its Xbox 360 video-game console from consumers in the first days after the model went on sale. The reports represented ''a very small fraction'' of the Xbox machines sold, a Microsoft spokeswoman, Molly O'Donnell, said. Users complained on Web sites including xbox-scene.com and teamxbox.com that games stopped during play and the machines unexpectedly turned off. Microsoft expects to sell up to 3 million Xbox 360 machines in the next three months. (Bloomberg News) Copper Producer Acquires Mexican Railroad Grupo Mexico, the world's third-largest copper producer, purchased a Mexican railroad company from the billionaire investor, Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, paying 3.26 billion pesos ($307 million) in stock of its transportation unit. Mr. Slim gave Grupo Mexico, which is based in Mexico City, 100 percent of the railroad, Ferrosur, in exchange for a 25 percent stake in Grupo Mexico's transportation division, spokesmen for the two sides said yesterday. Grupo Mexico already owns a Mexican railroad company, which will operate with Ferrosur. Ferrosur will allow Grupo Mexico to better fight competition from Kansas City Southern, owner of a 6,000-mile rail network linking the United States and Mexico.

Mr. Trichet indicated this would not be the first of a series of increases, but economists polled by Reuters predicted rates would climb to 2.75 percent by the end of 2006. NOW IT GETS SERIOUS -- Friday may have kicked off the holiday shopping frenzy, but today is also viewed as a crucial barometer by the industry, especially for Internet sales. As noted in the E-Commerce Report elsewhere in this section, the National Retail Federation recently bumped up its sales projections for the Christmas season by several billion dollars, for a 6 percent increase over last year. A survey conducted for the Conference Board indicates American households will spend an average $466 on gifts, while a poll by Sacred Heart University puts the figure at $970.

Recently, Japanese banks reported strong earnings and stocks have been made impressive gains. Today's government reports on the nation's jobless rate and industrial production will be telling.

Behind the News -- The television networks have yet another reason to hate TiVo, which first encroached on their turf by offering viewers the ability to watch television shows when they wanted, without the commercials. Now, TiVo could hurt the networks' attempts to develop another revenue stream by selling shows by the episode. For instance, ABC plans to sell downloads of ''Desperate Housewives'' on Apple iPods for 99 cents. But why pay, when you can download from TiVo for free? X-GAMES BEGIN The News -- Microsoft released its Xbox 360, its next-generation game machine, at midnight on Tuesday. Buyers lined up for hours to be among the first to purchase it. Behind the News -- Industry analysts said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long run. The real question is whether the 360 can outsell Sony's next-generation game console, PlayStation 3, which is not due out until spring.

You work for a good friend, but lately you've begun to have doubts about his business judgment. Is there a way to handle this without ruining the friendship? A. Nobody enjoys unpleasant discussions with friends, but your job requires that you put the interests of the company first, said Michael Gibbs, clinical professor of economics and human resources at the University of Chicago. ''Friendship is important, but at the end of the day, your top priority at work has to be the business itself,'' he said. ''When you start losing faith in your boss's ability to perform on the job, it's time to speak up.'' Q. Was it wise to agree to work for a friend in the first place? A. It's late in the game to question your decision, but it's worth remembering that mixing personal and professional lives can be tricky. Sure, it can be fun to work with people you know and respect. And when it works out over the long run, it can be very rewarding to share passion for a mission with pals you've known for years. Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, for example, were roommates in college, joined forces at Microsoft in 1980 and still work together today.

A1 American and Iraqi forces raiding an Iraqi government detention center in Baghdad discovered more than 600 prisoners packed into a cramped space, 13 of them mistreated so badly they had to be taken to a hospital, a senior American official said. A1 Chinese Officer Held in Deaths The commander of paramilitary forces who opened fire on villagers protesting land seizures was detained by the authorities in connection with the shootings, an extraordinary response that suggested high-level concern over whether the crackdown was justified. A1 Paris Suburb Symbolizes Riots La Courneuve, a Paris suburb of 35,000 people of 80 nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, has become a symbol of France's failure to integrate millions of Arab and African immigrants -- many of them Muslims -- and their French-born children and grandchildren. A1 Top Croat Suspect at the Hague For the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, taking custody of Ante Gotovina means the end of a four-year wait and the capture of one of its most-wanted suspects from the Balkan wars of the 1990's. A3 Rights Unit Faults Sudan Leader The United Nations should impose sanctions on top political and military leaders in Sudan and conduct an investigation of crimes against humanity committed in Darfur, Human Rights Watch said in a report that accuses senior officials, including President Omar al-Bashir, of playing major roles in making civilians the target of attacks. A5 Quebec Party Courts Minorities The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party has put up a record nine candidates of Haitian, African, Middle Eastern and Chinese origin this year to appeal to minorities and win toss-up districts in the Jan. 23 election, with the larger goal of winning a third separatist referendum expected in the next few years. A6 Runoff in Chile Election With ballots counted in the first round of voting in Chile's presidential election, a candidate who describes her rise as unlikely because she is ''a woman, a Socialist, separated and agnostic'' and a conservative billionaire businessman have advanced to a decisive runoff. A6 Finns Build Largest Reactor With continued spikes in gas and fuel prices, fears about overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming, Finland has decided to move ahead this year with the construction of the world's largest nuclear reactor, and a number of countries, including the United States, are freshening up proposals to build nuclear plants. A10 NATIONAL A16-23 A Clash Over Rebuilding Gulf Coast After Hurricane There is a broad clash along the Gulf Coast over whether to rebuild hurricane-damaged areas much as they were, to rebuild at a higher price, with more robust foundations and buildings raised above ground, or to cede large swaths of land to nature. The debate features a cast that includes disaster victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, as well as local, state and federal officials. A1 Tackling Medicaid Costs Members of Congress will soon plunge into battle over the future of Medicaid, as House and Senate negotiators try to resolve huge differences over legislation that would allow states to cut benefits and increase charges for millions of low-income people, including many children. Medicaid is a flash point in a larger budget bill on which Republican leaders say they plan to reach agreement by year's end. A21 Disputes Over Abuse Ban The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, predicted that Congress and the Bush administration would reach agreement this week over a proposal to ban torture of terrorism detainees, but those engaged in the negotiations said major differences remained. A19 Reporter Talks About Leak Viveca Novak, a reporter for Time magazine, said a lawyer for Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser, was surprised when she suggested to him in the first half of 2004 that Mr. Rove had probably been a source for the magazine's July 2003 article that discussed the C.I.A. officer at the heart of the leak case. A23 Virginia Governor Ponders Bid Propelled by his popularity at home, Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia has launched a major foray onto the national stage, raising millions of dollars for his likely presidential bid and visiting states already being courted by potential 2008 contenders. The latest stop came in Florida this weekend at a state Democratic Party convention. A16 Still No Decision on Inmate As fervor over the scheduled execution of Stanley Tookie Williams early Tuesday began to boil across California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined for a third day to announce a decision on a petition to spare the life of Mr. Williams, a former gangster and now-famous death row inmate, and commute his sentence to life in prison. A16 Administration Word of Choice Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Al Qaeda's ultimate goal is the re-establishment of the caliphate, with calamitous consequences for the United States. Caliphate is the term for the seventh-century Islamic empire that spanned the Middle East, spread to Southwest Asia, North Africa and Spain, then ended with the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. A19 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Two Men Are Charged With Officer's Murder The two men arrested in the fatal shooting of a police officer in the Bronx were charged with murder as new details emerged that led investigators to believe that the men were trying to steal Valium from a dead man's apartment when the officer, Daniel Enchautegui, confronted them. The suspects, who were shot by Officer Enchautegui before he died, remained in stable condition, the police said. B1 G.O.P. Looks for a Way Out New York State Republican leaders were supposed to vote on their preferred candidates for 2006 at a meeting today in Albany. But the vote is now in doubt: some Republicans want only to plot strategy and emerge with a party intact. B1 Two Killed in Queens A man and a woman were killed and two other people injured when a gunman opened fire in the vestibule of a building at a public housing project in the Rockaways, the police said. B3 Neediest Cases B4 ARTS E1-10 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Dressing the Men of the N.B.A. When the N.B.A. instituted a business-casual dress code this season to spruce up the league's image, plenty of grumbling ensued among players, commentators and fans alike. But the new dress code has boosted an already thriving specialty trade: The haberdashers and purveyors of fine dress shoes who cater to outsize professional athletes. D1 OBITUARIES A24-25 Bob Richardson A fashion photographer of the 1960's and 70's, he was 77. A24 BUSINESS DAY C1-16 Oil Company May Buy Rival ConocoPhillips is in advanced talks to buy Burlington Resources for more than $31 billion in the latest deal in the rapidly consolidating oil and gas industry, according to people involved in the talks. A20 Shift in Focus of Trade Talks Recognizing that little progress can be expected on issues like farm subsidies, officials at the trade talks in Hong Kong appear likely to focus on increasing exports from the poorest countries. C1 A Change For Time Warner A decision by Time Warner not to sell the ownership stake in America Online creates the potentially more difficult prospect of forging a relationship -- with either Google or Microsoft -- that would bolster AOL as it competes with its partner. C1 A Coup for Paramount Brad Grey, the chairman of Paramount Pictures, managed to pull off a coup by snatching DreamWorks SKG from NBC-Universal.

The program is run by private companies under federal supervision, and passengers pay a fee to be prescreened to get a biometric encoded identification card, which uses fingerprints and iris scans. Right now, the only operating program is called Clear, run at the airport in Orlando, Fla., by Verified Identity Pass of New York. Yesterday, the Saflink Corporation, a security company based in Bellevue, Wash., said it had expanded a partnership that now includes Microsoft to compete in the Registered Traveler program. Other partners include Johnson Controls., Expedia Corporate Travel and ID Technology Partners. The Transportation Security Administration has said a wide rollout of the program beyond Orlando would begin next year at airports nationally. At Orlando, more than 11,000 frequent fliers have already signed up for Clear, which costs $79.95 a year, the company's founder, Steven Brill, said. Saflink, in announcing yesterday that it had expanded its partnership, said its competing card could also be used as a credit card. A COURTYARD FOR MOSCOW -- The first Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Russia is scheduled to open this week with rooms ''offering spectacular views of the Kremlin,'' Marriott International says. The opening of the 218-room hotel will expand to 100,000 the number of guest rooms within Courtyard, Marriott's main moderately priced brand, which operates 700 hotels in the United States and abroad. Introductory rates at the Moscow Courtyard will start at $225 plus tax, the company said. FOR BETTER ONLINE BOOKING -- More than 80 percent of small-business travelers book trips directly on airline Web sites, but they are not especially impressed with the sites' flexibility, a new survey by the American Small Business Travelers Alliance, a nonprofit organization based in Flower Mound, Tex., finds. ''The Internet has done much to level the playing field for small-business travelers,'' Chet Gray, the vice president of the group, said in a statement. Small businesses, including the self-employed, do not typically have access to in-house booking systems used by big companies to arrange travel. While the survey shows small-business travelers are avidly booking online directly with airlines, ''opportunities remain for more tailored services on these sites,'' Mr. Gray said. ONE THICK MAGAZINE -- A new in-flight magazine, US Airways Magazine, with its first issue in January weighing in at a fat 200-plus pages, is being published by Pace Communications, which also puts out United Airlines' Hemispheres and Delta Air Lines' Sky magazines. US Airways Magazine, with a monthly printing of 375,000 copies, will replace America West Magazine and US Airways' Attach\u00e9 magazine, and will be available on all flights flown by the merged carriers and their regional partners. LEARN FRENCH WHILE YOU FLY -- Travelers on Singapore Airlines can now take interactive language-learning lessons in 20 different languages on the airlines' in-flight on-demand entertainment system. That doubles the number of language offerings available since the program began in June, the airline said. The programs are produced by Berlitz World Traveler. In all, Singapore's in-flight entertainment system, which it calls KrisWorld, has more than 500 on-demand video and audio options, including 60 movies.

[Page C1.] AOL Deal Is a Sign of Google's Dominance As recently as two weeks ago, Microsoft believed it was going to win the endorsement of Time Warner, AOL's parent, to form an advertising venture with AOL and become its provider of Web search services. But tomorrow Time Warner is expected to announce that it will instead renew its longstanding partnership with Google as the provider of its search tools. The turn of events shows just how much Google has supplanted Microsoft as the force to be reckoned with in technology. Advertising. [C1.] Filmmakers Seek Alternative Distribution Methods In the last several months, new ventures have been formed to help filmmakers find their audience -- online, on DVD and at the movie theater. Smaller movies with limited appeal could have the most to gain from alternative distribution, either through movie downloads or by bypassing studios altogether and selling DVD's directly to consumers. As many entrepreneurs did in the early days of the 1990's dot-com craze, they are experimenting with untested business models. [C1.] Satellite Radio Services Experience 'Stern Effect' Sirius Satellite Radio's $500 million investment to add Howard Stern to its programming starting in January has already paid big dividends -- even for its rival, XM Satellite Radio. ''Howard Stern has raised the awareness of the entire satellite radio category,'' said Hugh Panero, XM's president. [C1.] A Disappointing Fall for the WB Network Thirteen weeks into the fall television season, the WB Network has lost ground among the younger viewers it prizes. Of the four WB shows introduced in September, only ''Supernatural,'' about two brothers who confront evil apparitions while on an extended road trip, has made a mark with viewers. ''Related,'' an hourlong show that follows the lives of four adult sisters, left, started poorly but has picked up some viewers since moving to Monday nights. ''Twins,'' a comedy starring Melanie Griffith that is broadcast on Fridays, continues to run but has not caught on. [C7.] Heads Roll as Time Inc. Tries to Make Its Numbers Time Inc. is confronting profound changes in the market and a poor advertising cycle that has left the once-patrician publishing house scrambling to make its numbers, reorganizing in fits and starts, and last week, cutting loose some of its more valuable human assets.

Much of it was driven by the time of year, as corporate chiefs and government officials scrambled to tidy up things before the new year. A MOGUL IS BORN -- Ending a succession story that was never much of a mystery, Time Warner named Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the head of its movie and television businesses, as its president and chief operating officer. The promotion makes him heir apparent to the chairman and chief executive, Richard D. Parsons. Mr. Bewkes, 53, was one of two lieutenants to Mr. Parsons, 57. The other, Don Logan, 61, who heads Time Warner's publishing, cable and online properties, will retire at the end of the year and become nonexecutive chairman of the company's cable business. Mr. Bewkes is perhaps best known for his time at HBO, where he made his mark -- and HBO's reputation -- with hit programs like ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex and the City.'' In an interview, Mr. Bewkes said he did not anticipate any immediate executive changes. That may be because he will be busy fending off a campaign by the financier Carl C. Icahn to make major changes at the company to raise its stock price. LUNCH TAB -- A California jury ordered Wal-Mart Stores to pay $172 million in damages for failing to provide meal breaks to nearly 116,000 hourly workers as required under state law. The suit, filed on behalf of employees of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in California, argued that the chain violated state law more than eight million times. California law requires that employers provide a meal break of 30 minutes for every five hours on the clock. If the break is shorter than that, provided late or not at all, the employer must pay an hour's pay. Wal-Mart, which faces similar cases in about 40 other states, said it planned to appeal. LATEST INDICTMENT -- Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications, the dominant local phone company in 14 Western states, was indicted for selling more than $100 million worth of stock in his company in 2001 after learning that it would miss its financial goals but before making that news public. In a separate action in March, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Nacchio and other former executives, accusing them of overstating $3 billion in revenue from 1999 to 2002. It said the inflated figures helped Mr. Nacchio earn $216 million in pay and bonuses. In court, he pleaded not guilty. Several other former Qwest executives have already pleaded guilty and cooperated with government investigators. Qwest agreed last month to pay $400 million to investors hurt by the false financial statements. It also agreed to pay $250 million in fines to the S.E.C. last year. Prosecutors and the defense team are scheduled to meet on Jan. 20 in federal court in Denver, where Qwest is based, to set a timetable for the trial. PULLING THE PLUG -- Burdened with debts used to build power plants and with long-term contracts obligating it to sell electricity below the cost of making it, Calpine, a symbol of market deregulation, filed for bankruptcy protection. Calpine was hurt by the California energy crisis, which sent prices soaring after the company locked itself into long-term contracts, and by the collapse of Enron, which provided much of the liquidity in electricity-trading markets. Calpine, which employs 3,300 people, has $2 billion of debtor-in-possession financing, which is enough to keep its plants operating for now. But creditors are maneuvering to seize its assets, which include one of the world's largest geothermal plants, in Northern California. POWER GRAB -- In one of the largest takeovers in the electricity industry, the FPL Group agreed to buy Constellation Energy for $11 billion, creating a company that will own the nation's largest portfolio of electricity generation assets, with more than 45,000 megawatts of capacity. The combined company will have revenue of about $27 billion and will be the third-largest provider of nuclear-fueled electricity and one of the largest operators of coal-fired power plants. More mergers are likely after February, when the federal government repeals legislation that prevents conglomerates from using power monopolies to overcharge customers and subsidize other businesses. A DEAL, SORT OF -- Trade ministers from around the world agreed to stop subsidizing agricultural exports by 2013 and took steps to make it easier for the poorest nations to sell goods to industrialized nations. But the talks, held in Hong Kong under the guidance of the World Trade Organization, did little to persuade rich countries to lower import tariffs or limit subsidies to their own farmers and ranchers. The agreement helps negotiators as they try to finish a comprehensive set of trade rules by the end of 2007, in time for President Bush to submit it to Congress before a Congressional deadline expires. GAME OVER? -- Electronic Arts, the largest independent game publisher, and Activision, a big competitor, said holiday sales of their computer and video games were unexpectedly weak. NPD, a market research company, said domestic game sales fell 18 percent last month, to $700 million, from November a year ago. Paradoxically, a big reason for the slowdown may be the success of the Microsoft Xbox 360 console. Because Microsoft did not make enough to satisfy demand, consumers waiting to buy an Xbox 360 may have stopped buying games for other consoles, like the original Xbox and the Sony PlayStation 2. The slump may be reversed next year, when more Xbox 360's are in the hands of consumers and after Sony, the leading console maker, and Nintendo release new versions of their hardware.

A1 Law Cited in Defense of Spying The Bush administration, in its first formal response to Congress on the growing controversy over domestic spying, argued that the president's authorization of domestic spying was consistent with the 1978 law that governs the government's electronic eavesdropping. A20 As members of Congress seek more information about the eavesdropping program authorized by President Bush, their requests are being complicated by the fact that Congressional leaders in both parties acquiesced in the operation.
