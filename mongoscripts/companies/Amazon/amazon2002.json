There's Dumpy, a silky smooth, lime green Australian tree frog with a dreamy, smiley look on his face, sitting on the tray of Mr. Smith's business-card holder, breathing ever so gently that the nocturnal amphibian looks more like a gargoyle. Lurking under the moss in the terrarium by Mr. Smith's desk is a Brazilian rainbow boa constrictor that had 26 babies earlier this year, though the offspring have been relocated to separate lodgings in his Northport basement. When not between sheds, the boa's skin looks iridescent. Across the room is a tank with three larger boas wrapped around each other. Mr. Smith is more than happy to regale a rather skittish visitor by pulling out one of the eight-foot snakes and pointing out the bulge along its length that is most likely the rat it recently savored. Want to see another creepy crawler? From a vivarium in the next room, Mr. Smith proudly shows off an African millipede that freaks out his wife, Diane, every time he takes the coiled up brown critter out of the tank. ''It doesn't bite,'' said Mr. Smith, stroking the thousand-legged creature and touting it as an inexpensive pet that doesn't need walking and is content with a lump of lettuce and an occasional misting. ''It's a vegetable eater,'' he said. ''It has to feel a little bit comfortable and then it will start walking. It's interesting to see how the legs oscillate. The fear of every mom in America is that it gets out of the cage. That's why I have it here and not at my house.'' Mr. Smith's office is actually the headquarters of the Right Financial Group, which services computers and financial equipment in banks. But if his employees had any trepidation about working amid his extensive collection of reptiles, amphibians and insects in cages that make the rooms seem more like a pet shop, they have had to get over it. Since last January, when Mr. Smith launched Fauna magazine, the staff has been pulling double duty. Mr. Smith is an amateur herpetologist with big plans for this slick, full-color magazine stuffed with razor-sharp images of snake-necked turtles, legless lizards, giant hornets and the seldom seen ridge-nosed rattlesnake and articles with headlines like ''The Joy of Toads'' and ''Along Came a Spider.'' So far, he's been publishing 15,000 copies every other month, and toting his menagerie to schools all over the Island in search of an audience. His staff handles the business and advertising end; Mr. Smith does some editing but farms out assignments to scientists who know their invertebrates. The articles are geared to a general interest readers and are reviewed by an independent editorial board. ''When we do grow up, we'd like to be National Geographic,'' said Mr. Smith, 43. ''That's the benchmark for success in a nature magazine.'' Part of Mr. Smith's goal, he said, is to ''dispel the myth that snakes are evil monsters.'' ''On a survey, when people ask what are you most afraid of, even today, after Sept. 11, 50 percent of the respondents said snakes,'' he said. Tarantulas also rank up there on the scary charts, said Mr. Smith, reaching into another tank, plucking out an African scorpion while mimicking an eerie soundtrack with a shiver-inducing ''woooooooooooooo.'' ''This guy down here has a little danger involved,'' he said. ''There's a bit of a wives' tale in every James Bond movie. You see this thing is crawling on somebody and you think it is going to kill you like a tarantula,'' he said, knowledgeably noting that it's the claws that can clip a victim like a lobster and the stinger in the back is venomous, though not more than a yellow jacket sting. Mr. Smith said his hankering for creatures that others shirk away from propelled him to launch the magazine. ''I am a firm believer that these things have a right to exist,'' he said while readily admitting that though he's an environmentalist, the skin of a dead snake might make a fine-looking pair of shoes. ''There are enough people worrying about polar bears and jaguars. When you get into the wild and see the relationship between all these animals that live on the forest floor, that's why we started Fauna. It's the forgotten fauna. These are animals no one knows about or cares about anymore. They really are the basis of the food chain and the basis of life. Without them, everything stops. They are not in danger. They are just completely understudied and misunderstood.'' Mr. Smith's fascination with snakes started when he was 6. The family had just moved to West Babylon from Manhattan and he was having a hard time acclimating to the neighborhood. ''The kids across the hedges were screaming about something and out comes this little snake and I just instinctively went over and picked it up,'' he recalled. ''It just didn't dawn on me to do anything but.'' His soon-to-be best buddies were absolutely shocked. His mother ran out of the kitchen screaming ''put that down.'' The animal turned out to be a nonvenomous garter snake. From then on, he was hooked, venturing out on his bicycle all over the Island chasing down snakes, turtles and frogs, collecting them in a 55-gallon drum in the garage and peddling them to the pet departments of local department stores. Except for breaks during college, where he studied business economics, and when he got married, Mr. Smith kept up his hobby. When his oldest son, Tyler, now 12, caught a snake in the backyard as a toddler, Mr. Smith got the bug all over again and started breeding. For hibernation season coming up, Mr. Smith and his three children boxed their 50 to 60 reptiles into cozy sweater boxes and put them in the crawl space under the basement to sleep for the winter. Humans wiped out the rattlesnakes that were indigenous to Long Island more than 125 years ago, Mr. Smith said. He is looking farther. It was during a eco-tour of Costa Rica last year that he started talking about a business to promote reptiles and amphibians and the possibility of reincarnating Fauna was proposed. The name had been used on reptile magazines that came and went three times in the last 50 years. ''It means the animal kingdom, that's the true definition of the word,'' said Mr. Smith, hoping to someday make jungle tours of Costa Rica, Madagascar and the Amazon part of the magazine's outreach. ''We are just describing these forgotten species. We want people to understand that these animals certainly are not something you hit with a shovel if you see them in your garden, that they have a right to live.'' Literary Great Neck Great Neck has no shortage of literary aspirants. To celebrate the peninsula's writers, Muriel Turk, the director of programming for the Great Neck Library, initially compiled a list of people who grew up in Great Neck and became authors. ''We heard from very few of them but their parents called a lot,'' Ms. Turk said. However, she was inundated with calls from authors who had lived in town for decades and felt they should be remembered too. ''We are including writers of every ilk,'' Ms. Turk said, counting novelists, editors, critics, journalists, biographers, playwrights, essayists, songwriters and poets. The register topped 300. Among those who showed up at a dessert reception on a recent Sunday afternoon were Murray T. Bloom, who since he moved to the area 51 years ago, has written eight books, seven of them non-fiction. His novel, ''The Thirteenth Man,'' became a film, ''Last Embrace,'' with Roy Scheider; his 1969 book, ''The Trouble With Lawyers'' was a best seller. He said writers were attracted to Great Neck because of its proximity to the city and that the locals ''seemed to encourage literate pursuits.'' David J. Silverman, an enrolled agent and a Great Neck resident for three decades, was touting his ''Taxes for Dummies,'', now in its eighth edition. Robert H. Phillips, a psychologist, ticked off some of his more than 20 books on coping including, ''Overcoming Your Panic: A Strategy Guidebook,'' ''Coping with Diabetes'' and ''Coping with Breast Cancer.'' One-time author, Ricca Metz, was holding a copy of ''Maudie: A Positive Nursing Home Experience,'' a book about her mother published last year. Gordon Korman, who has written 40 children's books including ''No More Dead Dogs'' and ''I Want to Go Home,'' moved to Great Neck three years ago. He was thrilled to be recognized. ''That's one of the things about kids' books,'' Mr. Korman said. ''No one over the age of 14 knows who you are.'' Among literary luminaries on the list that will become part of the library's permanent collection were Herman Wouk, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Oscar Hammerstein and children's writers Margaret Wise Brown, Johanna Hurwitz and Esphyr Slobdkina. ''This is a library,'' Ms. Turk said.

Back in the mid-1990's, in the pre-dot-com dark ages, Waters was a computer consultant. One day, his wife, a used-book dealer, complained to him about how difficult it was to find any particular out-of-print book. Basically the only way to go about this was to scuffle through the local used-book stores or to pore through the 30 or so pages of AB Bookman, a weekly magazine that published lists of titles. Waters examined AB Bookman and had his flash of inspiration: why not create an Internet equivalent, a searchable database that would connect thousands of dealers, instead of only a few, and list millions of books, instead of thousands? And so in 1996 he founded Advanced Book Exchange, www.abebooks.com. Abebooks now links some 10,000 used- and rare-book dealers worldwide, each paying a monthly subscription according to how many titles they put online. Abebooks currently lists more than 38 million books, with 50,000 to 100,000 added every day. If you want to search for a newer book, Robert A. Caro's ''Master of the Senate,'' say, or an old paperback of Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451,'' you simply go to the Web site, type in the author's name and title and scores of choices pop up.

He dismissed forecasts as ''the game of the late 90's.'' And he had a point. For many years, Wall Street analysts have low-balled their earnings estimates so that their corporate customers could announce to the press that they had ''beaten'' those estimates. This particular game was exposed beginning in the late 1990's by fledgling Web sites, which routinely published more accurate earnings forecasts than the Wall Street pros. By the middle of 1998 the stock market began to trade off the Web estimates rather than the Street estimates -- which tells you how fully understood this quarterly forecast game had become even before the boom reached its turn-of-the-century heights. But so long as the stock market rose, Lou Dobbs was happy to listen to Wall Street and corporate big shots blather on about how they had beaten their earnings forecasts. He didn't scorn them; like every other serious reporter, he treated them as useful informants (when he wasn't distracted by his bid to make his Internet fortune in a doomed start-up called Space.com).

Spike Milligan, who died of kidney failure in February at 83, wrote and performed ''The Goon Show,'' a BBC radio program that was broadcast from 1951 to 1960. It generally had a cast numbering only three -- Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe -- but the trio played dozens of roles, ranging from witless vagrants to witless ministers of Parliament. The Goons' influence has long outlived its radio years. Troupes like Beyond the Fringe and Monty Python, by their own admission, were the Goons' clear descendants; some would even argue that their work was derivative of Milligan's anarchic style. ''The Goon Show'' never caught fire on this side of the Atlantic. With its fast pace, difficult accents and very English in-jokes, it sounded like a foreign language to American audiences. In the States, radio has long been regarded as a crippled form of TV, but Milligan brilliantly exploited every virtue of the form. That you could not see the action was the entire point. In one episode, Milligan, playing his central role of a toothless idiot named Eccles, inexplicably falls in love with one of Peter Sellers's characters. ''My little darling, I want you to have these,'' Milligan drawls, arriving at Sellers's door. ''I picked these for you. I grew them myself.'' Sellers tries to be gracious.
