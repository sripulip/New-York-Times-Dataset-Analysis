Fans of the Kennedy dynasty needn't despair, though. One of the books replacing it is RoseMarie Terenzio's ''Fairy Tale Interrupted,'' which enters the list at No. 8 and describes her years as John F. Kennedy Jr.'s executive assistant. The fairy tale her title refers to is ''Cinderella'': Terenzio grew up in a working-class Bronx neighborhood, and her book is a classic ''Bright Lights, Big City'' story of a young striver making it in the glamorous world of celebrity and publishing (she met Kennedy just as his magazine, George, was starting up in 1994, and worked for him until his death in a 1999 plane crash). She didn't like him at first. ''I wasn't immune to how handsome he was,'' she told The Boston Globe recently, ''but I was obsessed with Howard Stern.'' Eventually, though, she grew to see Kennedy as a sort of big brother. ''He'd come from behind and, like, stick gum in my hair,'' she told The New York Observer in 2003. ''He thought that sort of thing was really, really funny.'' DRIVE-IN: Robert Crais's new Elvis Cole mystery, ''Taken,'' shoots straight to the top in its first week on the hardcover fiction list. Crais sets his books in a hard-boiled, Chandleresque version of Los Angeles, where he lives, but his most devoted fans (they call themselves /''Craisies'') know he actually hails from the swamps of Louisiana. ''When I was a boy,'' he wrote in The Los Angeles Times a few years ago, ''the tallest nearby structure was the Florida Drive-In Theater, a shingle-sided, weather-beaten movie screen that jutted from the earth, . . . walled off from the surrounding homes by bamboo thickets and willow trees. But if I climbed the pecan tree behind my house, I could (and did) watch double-bills every night ('Hells Angels on Wheels' and 'Psych-Out,' 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Mondo Cane') and escape the insanity within my home.

Unforgettable in a different way was the retrospective in Berkeley, where Assange himself, then as now awaiting an extradition ruling in England, was Skyped in on a giant screen, like the mighty Oz, to pontificate on Western media's failure to turn the files into a kind of Nuremberg trial of American imperialism. About half the audience seemed on the verge of tossing their underwear at the screen. Add to that the three or four documentaries on the WikiLeaks adventure, the dozen books -- including, weirdly, Assange's unauthorized autobiography -- and a couple speculative Hollywood projects, in which I have a twofold interest.

No sobbing heroine could be more pitiable than Chris, a veteran of decades of writing scores for Hollywood movies. The death of his wife leaves him so brokenhearted that he returns to his native England and retreats to the seclusion of the Yorkshire Dales.

But while the real estate agent assures him no one has ever seen an apparition on the property, she neglects to explain that a former resident, Grace Fox, was hanged in 1953 for poisoning her husband.

Rice is as responsible as anyone for pop culture's current fascination with vampires -- her 1976 novel ''Interview With the Vampire'' represented a ''tectonic shift'' and a ''radical innovation,'' as the essayist Victoria Nelson puts it in her forthcoming book ''Gothicka,'' ''because it was the first to tell the story from the vampire's point of view.'' Now Rice has turned her attention to that other pop-Gothic standby, the werewolf. Her new novel once again mixes vaguely philosophical inquiries about good and evil with standard horror trappings: ''His fingers, or were they claws, touched his teeth and they were fangs! He could feel them descending, feel his mouth lengthening! . . . His voice was guttural, roughened. . . . His hands were thickly covered with hair!'' Hmmm. A growth spurt, a deeper voice, hair in new places -- if you're smirking here, well, Rice knows that werewolf stories have always echoed the truly scary specter of puberty. On Amazon, where she's a prolific reviewer of other people's work, she weighed in last June on ''The Company of Wolves,'' a 1984 movie by Neil Jordan (who also directed the big-screen version of ''Interview''). She called it a masterpiece. ''Werewolf films have for decades dealt with the emerging sexuality of adolescents,'' she wrote. ''But this film outdoes them all. . . . It's in a class with films like Cocteau's 'Beauty and the Beast.' It goes deep to the very core of what the werewolf myth has always been about.'' Disappointingly, Rice hasn't written an Amazon review of Glen Duncan's elegant, feral novel ''The Last Werewolf,'' which spent three weeks on the extended list last summer. SMILE: The tech entrepreneur Peter Diamandis is known for his Jules Verne-like gee-whiz enthusiasm for science; he's a leading proponent of commercial space travel and a financial supporter, through his X Prize Foundation, of big-idea solutions to world problems. So it's fitting that his new book, written with the science journalist Steven Kotler, would have a feel-good title like ''Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think.'' No peak oil worries for these two. ''Imagine a world of nine billion people with clean water, nutritious food, affordable housing, personalized education, top-tier medical care and nonpolluting, ubiquitous energy,'' they write in their first chapter. The book -- it's new at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list -- offers a whirlwind tour of the technologies that might get us there, including robotic nurses, in vitro meat grown from stem cells and water purified with nanofilters small enough to trap any pollutant. If nothing else, it's a nice reminder of how far we've come. ''Right now,'' they write, ''a Masai warrior with a cellphone has better mobile phone capabilities than the president of the United States did 25 years ago. And if he's on a smartphone with access to Google, then he has better access to information than the president did just 15 years ago.''", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 629, "_id": "4fd2a9928eb7c8105d894aab", "snippet": "After reinventing one pop-Gothic standby \u2014 the vampire \u2014 the novelist Anne Rice has moved on to the werewolf with \u201cThe Wolf Gift,\u201d which is No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2012/03/04/books/review/04insidelist/04insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2012/03/04/books/review/04insidelist/04insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gregory", "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-03-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "BookReview", "lead_paragraph": "After reinventing one pop-Gothic standby \u2014 the vampire \u2014 the novelist Anne Rice has moved on to the werewolf with \u201cThe Wolf Gift,\u201d which is No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list.", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR", "print_headline": "Inside the List", "content_kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": "628", "_id": "53f425a538f0d857ea2d0c47", "snippet": "After reinventing one pop-Gothic standby \u2014 the vampire \u2014 the novelist Anne Rice has moved on to the werewolf with \u201cThe Wolf Gift,\u201d which is No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"width": 75, "url": "images/2012/03/04/books/review/04insidelist/04insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2012/03/04/books/review/04insidelist/04insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": "Sunday Book Review", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Books and Literature", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Gregory", "rank": 1, "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-03-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, the Mexican billionaire, is financing an Internet television network called Ora.tv that will feature Larry King, the former CNN interviewer, in a return to the interviewer's chair.", "headline": {"main": "New Internet TV Network to Feature Larry King", "kicker": "Media Decoder"}, "abstract": "The network, to be announced Monday, will stream shows via the Internet to computers, phones and television sets, bypassing traditional distribution systems.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 708, "_id": "4fd3a3678eb7c8105d8ec979", "snippet": "The network, to be announced Monday, will stream shows via the Internet to computers, phones and television sets, bypassing traditional distribution systems.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/new-internet-tv-network-to-feature-larry-king/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"rank": "4", "name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet"}, {"rank": "3", "name": "persons", "value": "Slim Helu, Carlos"}, {"rank": "2", "name": "persons", "value": "King, Larry"}, {"rank": "5", "name": "subject", "value": "Television"}, {"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}, {"rank": "6", "name": "organizations", "value": "America Movil SAB de CV"}, {"rank": "7", "name": "organizations", "value": "Ora.tv"}, {"rank": "8", "name": "unknown", "value": "America Movil SAB de CV|AMX|NYSE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Brian", "rank": 1, "lastname": "STELTER"}], "original": "By BRIAN STELTER"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2012-03-11T23:05:58Z", "section_name": "Business"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, the Mexican billionaire, is financing an Internet television network called Ora.tv that will feature Larry King, the former CNN interviewer, in a return to the interviewer's chair.

But any writer with a distinctive style runs the risk of self-parody. Consider Tom Wolfe, who used exclamation points and electric Kool-Aid prose to help reinvent journalism before moving on to Technicolor zeitgeisty novels like ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ''A Man in Full.'' Wolfe's new novel, ''Back to Blood,'' won't be released until this fall. But the book's description on Amazon makes it sound like the sort of sprawling social novel that might have been churned out by a white-suited Tom Wolfe cyborg. Here it is: ''As a police launch speeds across Miami's Biscayne Bay -- with officer Nestor Camacho on board -- Tom Wolfe is off and running. Into the feverous landscape of the city, he introduces the Cuban mayor, the black police chief, a wanna-go-muckraking young journalist and his Yale-marinated editor; an Anglo sex-addiction psychiatrist and his Latina nurse by day, loin lock by night -- until lately, the love of Nestor's life; a refined and oh-so-light-skinned young woman from Haiti and her Creole-spouting, black-gang-banger-stylin' little brother; a billionaire porn addict, crack dealers in the 'hoods, 'de-skilled' conceptual artists at the Miami Art Basel Fair, 'spectators' at the annual Biscayne Bay regatta looking only for that night's orgy, yenta-heavy ex-New Yorkers at an 'Active Adult' condo and a nest of shady Russians.'' All three of Wolfe's previous novels have been best sellers; the most recent, ''I Am Charlotte Simmons,'' spent 15 weeks on the hardcover list in 2004 and 2005.", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 584, "_id": "4fd2a7c78eb7c8105d89111f", "snippet": "Tom Wolfe\u2019s new novel, \u201cBack to Blood,\u201d due out this fall, has a plot description that is full to bursting.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2012/03/09/books/review/09wolfe/09wolfe-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2012/03/09/books/review/09wolfe/09wolfe-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gregory", "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-03-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Culture", "lead_paragraph": "Diana Vishneva took on a Martha Graham role in \u201cErrand Into the Maze,\u201d an adaptation of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.", "headline": {"seo": "Martha Graham Gala Starring a Ballerina, Diana Vishneva", "main": "Modern Movement With an Ancient Monster", "kicker": "Dance Review", "print_headline": "Modern Movement With an Ancient Monster", "content_kicker": "Dance Review"}, "abstract": "Brian Seibert reviews concert of dance works by choreographer Martha Graham, performed by the Martha Graham Dance Company and featuring guest dancer Diana Vishneva, at City Center.", "print_page": "5", "word_count": "545", "_id": "515daa61cf28d0219d002499", "snippet": "Diana Vishneva took on a Martha Graham role in \u201cErrand Into the Maze,\u201d an adaptation of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/arts/dance/martha-graham-gala-starring-a-ballerina-diana-vishneva.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Dance", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "Y", "value": "Dancing", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Maryinsky Ballet", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "value": "American Ballet Theater", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "Y", "value": "Graham, Martha, Dance Co", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "Y", "value": "Vishneva, Diana", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "value": "Graham, Martha", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Brian", "rank": 1, "lastname": "SEIBERT"}], "original": "By BRIAN SEIBERT"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-03-17T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "BookReview", "lead_paragraph": "Tom Wolfe\u2019s new novel, \u201cBack to Blood,\u201d due out this fall, has a plot description that is full to bursting.", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "print_headline": "Inside the List", "content_kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": "583", "_id": "53f4655e38f0d857ea2d0fb5", "snippet": "Tom Wolfe\u2019s new novel, \u201cBack to Blood,\u201d due out this fall, has a plot description that is full to bursting.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"width": 75, "url": "images/2012/03/09/books/review/09wolfe/09wolfe-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2012/03/09/books/review/09wolfe/09wolfe-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": "Sunday Book Review", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Books and Literature", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Gregory", "rank": 1, "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-03-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "lead_paragraph": "Diana Vishneva took on a Martha Graham role in \u201cErrand Into the Maze,\u201d an adaptation of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.", "headline": {"main": "Martha Graham Gala Starring a Ballerina, Diana Vishneva", "kicker": "Dance Review"}, "abstract": "Brian Seibert reviews concert of dance works by choreographer Martha Graham, performed by the Martha Graham Dance Company and featuring guest dancer Diana Vishneva, at City Center.

Or would this novel (which I loved) have been relegated to ''Women's Fiction,'' that close-quartered lower shelf where books emphasizing relationships and the interior lives of women are often relegated? Certainly ''The Marriage Plot,'' Eugenides's first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Middlesex,'' was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about women's lives never find a way to escape ''Women's Fiction'' and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men (and, yes, some women -- more about them later), are prominently displayed and admired. This is a tricky subject. Bringing up the women's question -- I mean the women's fiction question -- is not unlike mentioning the national debt at a dinner party. Some people will get annoyed and insist it's been talked about too much and inaccurately, and some will think it really matters. When I refer to so-called women's fiction, I'm not applying the term the way it's sometimes used: to describe a certain type of fast-reading novel, which sets its sights almost exclusively on women readers and might well find a big, ready-made audience. I'm referring to literature that happens to be written by women.

Even so, this 86-minute breeze through civilization, its history and self-made discontents from the Canadian filmmakers Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks -- which concentrates on the present and future costs of familiar environmental and economic catastrophes -- is very much a doomsday documentary.

(The American paperback runs 211 pages, 53 of them for notes.) Specifically the book charts the rise and fall of societies -- in the Stone Age, on Easter Island, the Romans and the Maya -- seeing a cautionary tale about progress in their successes and declines. In the Old Stone Age, to take one bleak example, humans so perfected their hunting tools and techniques, like running a herd of mammoths over a cliff instead of spearing a few for dinner, that they drove their prey into extinction.

Blogging gave writers another way to reach readers, to promote their work or air their grievances or test their ideas in mini-essays that played to their strengths. But technology evolves, and despite some notable holdouts (Elif Batuman is one) Twitter has killed the blogging star. Now writers connect with their publics in 140 characters or fewer. The medium especially favors authors with distinct voices, preferably funny ones, who can toss off pithy observations or one-liners -- authors like Anne Lamott, say, whose new book, ''Some Assembly Required,'' enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 9. Lamott's best writing has always had the dashed-off immediacy of a good tweet; her excellent 1993 book ''Operating Instructions'' strung together one punch line after another to capture the joys and anxieties of her son's first year of life. The new book is a sequel -- her son (and co-author), Sam, now has a son of his own -- and to promote it, Lamott has been posting her daffy, neurotic, inspirational shtick in the telegraphic shorthand that Twitter followers are used to. From an airplane on the first leg of her recent book tour, she wrote: ''New low @ 30,000 feet -- checked Amazon sales rank of 'Some Assembly . . . ' @/samlamott trying to wrestle iPad out of my hands. I need air marshal.'' Later, in Washington, she was more reflective: ''D.C.; cherry blossoms in full pink pyrotechnic bloom. Humbling & convincing (but I'm easy). 3rd great prayer, after Help and Thanks, is Wow!'' Almost 20 years ago I sat in on Lamott's writing class in Marin County, Calif., where one of the students turned out to be her former elementary school principal. Even in second grade she'd been a bundle of comic nervous energy, he told me. ''We all knew she was going to be a star.'' DAYDREAM BELIEVER: The science journalist Jonah Lehrer tops the hardcover nonfiction list this week with his new book of popular neurology, ''Imagine: How Creativity Works.'' As he did in his previous two books, ''Proust Was a Neuroscientist'' and the best-selling ''How We Decide,'' Lehrer surveys the current state of research and builds a host of anecdotes into a larger story about how the brain functions: in this case, to help foster our imaginations. Not everyone is persuaded -- at The Washington Post and the Web site The Millions, reviewers have questioned whether the science is as clear-cut as Lehrer claims -- but even skeptics praise his command of the material. And he has a passion for translating scientific concepts for the rest of us. On NPR's ''Fresh Air,'' Lehrer told Dave Davies that amphetamines had helped Auden hone his poems and that relaxed people are more likely to have flashes of inspiration. ''If someone's in a good mood, you know, they'll solve more problems,'' he said. ''This also explains, of course, why the shower is such a rich source of epiphany . . . because we are very relaxed. We're letting ourselves daydream. We also can't take our smartphones into the shower, at least not yet.''

The new product was the Game Boy -- a hand-held, battery-powered plastic slab that promised to set gamers loose, after all those decades of sweaty bondage, from the tyranny of rec rooms and pizza parlors and arcades. The unit came bundled with a single cartridge: Tetris, a simple but addictive puzzle game whose goal was to rotate falling blocks -- over and over and over and over and over and over and over -- in order to build the most efficient possible walls. (Well, it was complicated. You were both building walls and not building walls; if you built them right, the walls disappeared, thereby ceasing to be walls.) This turned out to be a perfect symbiosis of game and platform. Tetris's graphics were simple enough to work on the Game Boy's small gray-scale screen; its motion was slow enough not to blur; its action was a repetitive, storyless puzzle that could be picked up, with no loss of potency, at any moment, in any situation. The pairing went on to sell more than 70 million copies, spreading the freedom of compulsive wall-building into every breakfast nook and bank line in the country.", "headline": {"main": "Just One More Game..."}, "abstract": "Sam Anderson article explores how time-wasting video games have escaped the arcade and become more popular due to the rise of smart phones.

Gathered around the room that evening were 55 people, old and young, in suits and T-shirts, everyone hoping that his or her idea could buck the odds. Chris Landano, a young, wiry firefighter, told me about his TrakPak360, a utility belt -- perfect for photographers, carpenters, ''anybody who carries tools!'' -- which is equipped with a plastic track that allows pouches to swing around easily. Lorraine Muriello, a woman from New Jersey, described her borderline-brilliant (but extremely easy to rip off) idea: No Sweat Towels, gym towels with zippered pouches for keys and cellphones. Her friend, Cheryl Manzone, told me she has filed countless patents over the past few decades (shoes with interchangeable heels, a compact diaper travel kit) and is now pitching her latest innovation, Stickpods, which are like straws with legs. They're for holding lollipops, among other treats. The one invention already on sale came from Gregory Quinn, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union. Quinn, a veteran driver (''Truck, taxi, limo, you name it'') has begun selling his Stimulus Pad, a kind of massaging car-seat cover that offers the equivalent of 15 masseurs' hands on your back all at once.

So if one novelist reviews another, they'll often overlap in terms of tone or themes or prose style. But sometimes a counter/intuitive pairing works just as well. In 1988, Anne Tyler reviewed ''Libra,'' Don DeLillo's novel about the Kennedy assassination, in these pages. Tyler and DeLillo were already literary heavyweights, but you wouldn't have looked for them on the same fight card -- DeLillo had a reputation as a chilly analyst of paranoia and pervasive social forces, while Tyler was known for her intimate dissections of grief and domestic estrangement. (That hasn't changed: ''The Beginner's Goodbye,'' her novel about a man haunted by his dead wife, is at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list.) Still, she loved ''Libra,'' and came away persuaded that the C.I.A. could have been involved in the assassination. DeLillo ''must have had the same source materials available to anyone else,'' she wrote. ''But he takes the stale facts and weaves them into something altogether new. . . . That finally we're interested less in the physical events of the assassination than in the pitiable and stumbling spirit underlying them proves 'Libra' to be a triumph.'' DeLillo's novel went on to spend five weeks on the best-seller list. GIVEAWAY: John Grisham's first baseball novel, ''Calico Joe,'' hits the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 1. These days Grisham is a standby of another list as well: Forbes's annual ranking of the world's top-earning authors, which last year put him at No. 7 with estimated earnings of $18 million. But it wasn't always so. Earlier this month Grisham was interviewed for the Newsweek column ''My Favorite Mistake,'' and he looked back to the late 1980s, when he was struggling to sell his debut novel, the legal thriller ''A Time to Kill.'' Only 5,000 copies of the first edition were printed, and at one point Grisham himself owned 1,500 of those at his small law office in Mississippi. ''We stacked them in the reception area, around my secretary's desk, in the hallways, in my office. We couldn't move but for all the copies of 'A Time to Kill,' '' he said. ''The boxes were everywhere, and I would just give them away. If one of my clients wanted a book, I'd try to sell it. If not, I'd give it away. I'd sell them for 10 bucks, 5 bucks. I used them for doorstops. I couldn't get rid of these books.'' Today, on the used-book Web site AbeBooks.com, a signed first edition of ''A Time to Kill'' might fetch as much as $4,000. ''That's about $6 million, the way I do the math,'' Grisham told Newsweek. ''We had no way of knowing then, but I sure wish I had some of those books back. I blew it.''", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 629, "_id": "4fd100ec8eb7c8105d5bc122", "snippet": "Anne Tyler, whose new novel is on the list at No. 11, was the counterintuitive choice to review Don DeLillo\u2019s \u201cLibra\u201d in the Book Review in 1988.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2012/04/22/books/review/22insidelist/22insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2012/04/22/books/review/22insidelist/22insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gregory", "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-04-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Microsoft to Take Stake in Nook Unit of Barnes & Noble", "kicker": "dealbook"}, "abstract": "Microsoft announced on Monday that it would invest $300 million in the Nook division for a 17.6 percent stake.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "671", "_id": "4fd3a4488eb7c8105d8eeb3d", "snippet": "Microsoft announced on Monday that it would invest $300 million in the Nook division for a 17.6 percent stake.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/microsoft-to-take-stake-in-barnes-nobles-nook-unit/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Dealbook", "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Michael", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "DE LA MERCED", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2, "firstname": "Julie", "lastname": "BOSMAN"}], "original": "By MICHAEL J.

To judge from an interview she gave last year, Quindlen -- unlike Nora Ephron -- isn't one to feel bad about her neck as she stares down her 60s. ''After a number of years working on it very, very hard with my trainer, I now can stand on my head,'' she told Kathy Patrick, a Texas hairstylist who owns a combination bookstore and beauty shop (a literary salon!) called Beauty and the Book. ''And I'm pretty proud of that,'' Quindlen continued. ''The fact that I couldn't stand on my head when I was 22, and I can now that I'm 58, is something that I take a lot of pride in. . . . I think when you're over 50, you get less and less and less fearful of things, because you understand that, you know, what's the worst that can happen if you try and fail? So my experience is that most of the women I know over 50 really don't give a rip what anybody thinks anymore. And it means that they wind up taking chances they might not have taken when they were 25, and doing things they might not have tried. And I think that's one reason why I feel really good about where I am right now.'' LIGHT BULB: Roberto Martin's ''Vegan Cooking for Carnivores'' is new on the hardcover advice, how-to and miscellaneous list at No. 8. Martin works as a personal chef for Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, and he appears regularly on DeGeneres's talk show to demonstrate the vegan recipes he prepares for them. But he's not a vegan himself, he told The Associated Press recently. And neither was DeGeneres until four years ago: ''I've always called myself an animal lover. And yet I ate them,'' she told the reporter Michele Kayal. ''I would be driving past these cows on pastures and think, 'What a lovely life that is,' and I'd go and order a steak. It takes a click, just one light bulb, and you're like 'I can't do that anymore.'

Actually, it was in this newspaper. I read the accompanying article while riding on a train from New Haven to New York when I was in my mid-20s. Although I had graduated a few years earlier, I was still living in the town where I'd gone to college. New Haven was cheap, and book reviews paid money back then. This was in the early '90s. The train was quiet. No one had a cellphone. The article in the newspaper said that a search party believed it had found a piece of Earhart's plane on an atoll in the Pacific. And maybe a piece of her shoe. I didn't know much about Amelia Earhart, but the idea of her surviving on a desert island, even if only for a little while, appealed to me, sang to me, waved furiously to me from a great distance. Perhaps this was because I felt at the time as if I were flying hopelessly around the world and searching for land, longing for one of those islands of stability some of us keep looking for in our 20s, a braceleted wrist held up to the face, hand shielding our eyes from the harsh sun of adulthood, not realizing that we will have to build that island for ourselves. Whatever the reason, I was certainly not the first person to be fascinated by Earhart's disappearance. Nor the last. This July 2 it will be 75 years since she vanished while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, and people are still wondering what happened to her, still compelled by the mystery -- Was she a spy? Was she captured by the Japanese? Did she sink or survive? -- still searching for her shoe.", "headline": {"main": "Amelia Earhart, Found and Lost", "kicker": "OPINION"}, "abstract": "Op-Ed article by Jane Mendelsohn reflects on the influence Amelia Earhart had on her life as an author, and why the mystery of Earhart's disappearance endures.

If, after three rounds, the panelists still can't figure it out, the player takes home the grand prize. Each game ends with a demonstration of the contestant's abilities. At 9, in a preview of ''Hollywood Heights,'' an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela ''Alcanzar una Estrella,'' Brittany Underwood plays Loren Tate, a shy high school senior who finds herself catapulted to superstardom when she wins a songwriting contest sponsored by her rock idol, Eddie Duran (Cody Longo) -- and, eventually, his love. The show, which also features a multiple-episode guest appearance by James Franco, has its official premiere next Monday. 7:30 A.M. (Fox Movie Channel) SONS AND LOVERS (1960) Jack Cardiff directed this adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence novel about the joy, sorrow and frustration that grow out of a strong bond between a mother (Wendy Hiller) and son (Dean Stockwell) in a northern England coal town, not unlike the one where Lawrence grew up. ''Oddly enough, the powerful passions that race and foam through the original tale, which shocked and dismayed a lot of people when it was published in 1913, do not surge up in the picture,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. ''The strong possessiveness of a mother's love for a son, transferred to him from his father, comes through as a hot, but essentially lavalike, strain of attentiveness and jealous affection untouched by the thrust of Dr. Freud.'' The film received seven Oscar nominations, including best director for Mr. Cardiff and best actor for Trevor Howard as the discarded father, a miner who wed above his social class.

The twins, who were delivered at 3:50 and 3:51, respectively, stand to inherit some share of a fortune that Forbes estimates is worth a billion dollars. Coronel's husband, who was not present for the birth, is a legendary tycoon who overcame a penurious rural childhood to establish a wildly successful multinational business. If Coronel elected to leave the entry for ''Father'' on the birth certificates blank, it was not because of any dispute over patrimony. More likely, she was just skittish about the fact that her husband, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, is the C.E.O. of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, a man the Treasury Department recently described as the world's most powerful drug trafficker. Guzm\u00e1n's organization is responsible for as much as half of the illegal narcotics imported into the United States from Mexico each year; he may well be the most-wanted criminal in this post-Bin Laden world. But his bride is a U.S. citizen with no charges against her. So authorities could only watch as she bundled up her daughters and slipped back across the border to introduce them to their dad. Known as El Chapo for his short, stocky frame, Guzm\u00e1n is 55, which in narco-years is about 150. He is a quasi-mythical figure in Mexico, the subject of countless ballads, who has outlived enemies and accomplices alike, defying the implicit bargain of a life in the drug trade: that careers are glittering but brief and always terminate in prison or the grave. When Pablo Escobar was Chapo's age, he had been dead for more than a decade. In fact, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chapo sells more drugs today than Escobar did at the height of his career. To some extent, this success is easily explained: as Hillary Clinton acknowledged several years ago, America's ''insatiable demand for illegal drugs'' is what drives the clandestine industry. It's no accident that the world's biggest supplier of narcotics and the world's biggest consumer of narcotics just happen to be neighbors. ''Poor Mexico,'' its former president Porfirio D\u00edaz is said to have remarked.

I'm not suggesting that she won't be interested in their contents, but that she may prefer to digest them in a different form.

Same-day shipping is logistically complicated and money-losing \u2014 and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers big and small are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com.\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big retailers like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Macy\u2019s and Target have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots going on in this space, and it\u2019s all driven by Amazon,\u201d said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not really being driven by consumers at the moment.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot-com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits \u2014 only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors.</p>", "print_page": null, "word_count": 304, "_id": "50dda82800315214fbb817ae", "snippet": "This holiday season, same-day shipping replaced free shipping as the new must-have promotion for e-commerce companies, <a...", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/daily-report-online-retailers-push-same-day-shipping/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"organization": "THE NEW YORK TIMES", "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "person": []}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2012-12-28T09:02:29Z", "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "Correction", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Summary", "lead_paragraph": "Corrections appearing in print on December 28, 2012.", "headline": {"main": "Corrections: December 28, 2012", "print_headline": "Corrections"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "545", "_id": "50dd103c00315214fbb81701", "snippet": "Corrections appearing in print on December 28, 2012.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/pageoneplus/corrections-december-28-2012.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": [], "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Corrections"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Pearson to Take Stake in Nook Unit", "kicker": "DealBook"}, "abstract": "The British publishing and education company Pearson said it would invest $89.5 million in the Nook business at Barnes & Noble.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 899, "_id": "50dda8a200315214fbb817af", "snippet": "The British publishing and education company Pearson said it would invest $89.5 million in the Nook business at Barnes & Noble.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/pearson-to-take-stake-in-nook-unit/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Microsoft Corporation", "name": "organizations", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Pearson Plc", "name": "organizations", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Barnes & Noble Inc", "name": "organizations", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "name": "subject", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Book Trade and Publishing", "name": "subject", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Barnes & Noble Nook", "name": "subject", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Leslie", "lastname": "KAUFMAN"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2, "firstname": "Julia", "lastname": "WERDIGIER"}], "original": "By LESLIE KAUFMAN and JULIA WERDIGIER"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2012-12-28T09:04:58Z", "section_name": "Business Day"}, {"type_of_material": "", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "British education and media publisher Pearson Plc has agreed to acquire a 5 percent stake in Barnes &amp;
