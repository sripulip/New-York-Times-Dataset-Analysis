A9 World Briefing A10 NATIONAL A16-25 Soft-Money Spending Outstrips Campaigns' Own Republican and Democratic Party organizations are far outspending both special interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in the presidential election. Political analysts say the trend is transforming the parties and their soft-money donors this year from supporting players into full partners in the advertising efforts. A1 The Gore campaign is raising millions for an obscure fund limited to paying for legal and accounting costs. But recent solicitation letters for the fund suggest a donation will help the campaign attack Republicans, causing some campaign finance experts and Bush aides to say the messages are misleading and run afoul of federal election law. A23 Vice President Al Gore challenged Gov. George W. Bush to agree to ban the use of unregulated party money on television and radio advertising for the rest of the presidential campaign. The night before, Mr. Bush told Larry King in a CNN interview that he was unlikely to agree to such a pact because he did not trust the Democrats to abide by it.

Levy and the United Way of Westchester and Putnam Counties pressed Boy Scout officials in the region to defy the parent organization on the Scouts' policy on gays. B1 Public Interest in Private Space Most privately owned public spaces in New York City, created in a tradeoff meant to give pedestrians a little extra breathing room as developers got extra-large buildings, have failed in some way, a study found. Gates that should be open are padlocked. Chairs meant for the public are used by restaurants. Plazas are filled with Dumpsters. And some spaces are just plain uninviting.

Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing.

The early comics were rife with intimations of lesbianism, bondage and discipline. The all-female Paradise Island bore more than a passing resemblance to Lesbos, and the superheroine's favorite epithet was ''Suffering Sappho!'' She managed to get herself tied up or bound by exotic methods in virtually every installment. In one choice panel, Wonder Woman hogties an Atlantean giantess while exclaiming, ''On Paradise Island where we play many binding games this is considered the safest method of tying a girl's arms!'' ''Women enjoy submission,'' insisted Marston, who lived in a menage trois. Ninety percent of Wonder Woman's fans may have been male (the Nancy Sinatra boots, spangly shorts and Versace bustier didn't hurt). The text by Daniels, who has also given the same super-treatment to Superman and Batman, is unfortunately not as colorful as its subject matter, but there are some wonderful arcana: a photograph of a very young Debra Winger as Wonder Girl standing next to the Junoesque Lynda Carter from the television series, and one of a Wonder-Woman-shaped scissors.
