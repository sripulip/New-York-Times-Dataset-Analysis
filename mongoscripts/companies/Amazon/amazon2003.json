In just its first month of operation the service, by the company's estimate, has sold three million songs online, at 99 cents each. This is an impressive figure considering the limited access that music fans now have to the service. Less than 1 percent of the country's home computers are Macintoshes that are compatible with the iTunes Music Store, and only a fraction of those have a broadband connection to the Internet. But it would not be an online success story without a complicating twist. That complication came this week when the specter of the music industry, which has been publicly supportive of iTunes, began to loom over Apple. The success of iTunes, after all, depends on cooperation from the music business, which controls the songs that iTunes wants in its collection. Apparently trying to stay in the record industry's good graces, iTunes removed a service it had previously offered customers. Called Rendezvous, the service enabled listeners and their friends to access one another's music and listen to it -- but not download it -- from any computers. Hackers, however, had figured out how to download the music as well, creating programs with names like iLeach and iSlurp.

In the action-romance film, directed by Martin Campbell, Ms. Jolie, above, plays Sarah Jordan, who follows a hot-tempered humanitarian doctor (Clive Owen) for a decade to places like Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya. The plot involves the doctor in weapons dealing for the Central Intelligence Agency. Steve Hansch, an adviser to the filmmakers and a researcher at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University in Washington, said, ''By popularizing an image of aid agencies working under instructions from the C.I.A., 'Beyond Borders' may torpedo their real work in the field.'' If the film is widely seen, he added, it ''is likely to endanger the lives of real aid workers in real aid operations.'' Sandra Mitchell, the International Rescue Committee's vice president for governmental relations and advocacy, told Reuters: ''We don't run guns. There are clear principles and guidelines.'' The BBC reported yesterday that a spokesman for the distributor, Path\u00e9, declined to comment.

Set aboard a submarine, it tells of the fears and conflicts of the crew, its director, Marc Pommering, told Reuters. Erlangen's mayor, Siegfried Balleis, pressured the theater to withdraw the production because it would ''darken the image of the town,'' Reuters reported. Although other critics said the play portrayed the Nazis too positively, ''The Wolves'' was banned by the Nazi propaganda minister, Josef Goebbels, because he thought it was insufficiently favorable to the Nazi cause.

Died November 20, 2003 in Los Altos Hills, California, at the age of 80. He was predeceased by his loving and beloved wife of 54 years, Rose Kleiner (2001).

Eugene was one of the founding fathers of Silicon Valley, a journey that began with the German occupation of his birthplace Vienna in 1938, forcing his family to escape through France, Belgium and Portugal, and finally find passage to the United States where they settled in New York in 1941. At the end of World War II after serving in the United States Army, Eugene took advantage of the GI Bill and earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Polytechnic University, New York, and a Master's of Industrial Engineering from New York University. In 1947 he was married to Rose Wassertheil, who had escaped the German invasion of Poland in 1939. In 1952 his son Robert was born, and four years later the family moved to California after Nobel Prize winner William Shockley recruited Eugene from Western Electric to join him and seven other scientists and engineers to start Shockley Laboratories in Palo Alto. In 1957, these eight men, who became known as the ''Fairchild Eight'', broke away from Shockley and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; the first successful company to manufacture the silicon based transistor. This effort spawned the industry which would eventually transform Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley and was the basis for all of today's information technology. In 1959 his daughter Lisa was born, and two years later the family moved to a new house that they built in Los Altos Hills, in which Eugene and Rose would live for the rest of their lives. In 1962, he left Fairchild to start ventures of his own including Edex Teaching Machines which was bought by Raytheon. As a limited partner with Davis & Rock, and a first round investor in Intel, Eugene began a new interest in venture capital. In 1972 he joined with Tom Perkins to form the partnership now known as Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers which has spawned over 300 companies including Compaq, Genentech, Tandem Computers, Sun, and Amazon. Since becoming ''Partner Emeritus'' at KPCB, Eugene served on numerous corporate boards, advisory committees, and college boards. In 1989 he received an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Polytechnic University where he had served as a Trustee.

Dr. Dean is marginalized in other ways as well: a heretofore obscure governor from a tiny state best known for its left-wing ice cream and gay civil unions, a flip-flopper on some pivotal issues and something of a hothead.
