Prison Talk, a big board with nearly 150,000 members and 2,500 regular readers a day, is a case in point. It caters to what turns out to be an underserved consumer niche: family and friends of the incarcerated. Prison inmates, whose Internet access is extremely limited, also turn up periodically, usually seeking pen pals through a third party. The site, which costs nothing to join, was founded seven years ago and has drawn around 3.5 million messages, including poetry, small talk, business deals, memoirs, sermons, laments, photo albums and ideological screeds.

While recent summers were cool, most Napa winemakers agree that 10-year averages are the hottest in memory. Too often, a result has been overripe grapes, and the cooked flavors and throat-searing alcohol that accompany them. If temperatures continue to rise even slightly, Napa could be in trouble. Most superior grape-growing regions enjoy cool summer nights, which allow vines to recover from the stress of the day's heat. Lose that, and you're left with grapes better suited for bulk wines. ''If average nighttime temperatures increase even a few degrees,'' says Andrew Walker, a professor in the department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, ''then there's really no difference between Napa and the Central Valley.' Tony Truchard, whose Truchard Vineyards is located in Carneros, Napa's coolest pocket, says: ''If I could start the California wine industry over again, I wouldn't plant on the valley floor at all. It's too hot, and it's going to get hotter.'' But those mature vineyards are considered Napa's most prestigious. And Napa retains other desirable attributes. ''In Napa, we've got rootstocks we like, soils we think are the best,'' Pat Garvey, an owner of Flora Springs Winery and Vineyards, says. ''We're not going anywhere.'' Instead, Garvey and others have set out to mitigate the heat's effect. The mandate is clear: undo everything that was done in the name of ripeness during the 1990s. Those cabernet clones imported from Bordeaux because they ripen so easily? Rip them out and plant something more reluctant. Vines positioned near the ground to soak up radiant heat? Install a trellis system and pull them higher. Wineries have started planting vineyards on a northeast-southwest axis, which minimizes strong afternoon sunlight. They add cover crops -- clover, bell bean -- to compete with the vines and prolong the fruit's maturation process. And they're removing fewer leaves. ''We used to try for as much sun as possible, but we've backed off,'' says Doug Shafer of Shafer Vineyards. ''Shading has become really important. Without it, we get roasted fruit.'' Trying to reduce alcohol in the winery is like trying to bring a snapshot into focus in the darkroom, but it can be done. Perhaps the most widespread technique, though one rarely acknowledged, is dilution. ''You use what we call 'Jesus Units,' because they turn water into wine,'' says the owner of a Napa Winery known for its elegant cabernets. Manual sorters, previously employed to detect rot, now look for overripe grapes. ''It's a large investment in labor, but it makes a significant difference,'' Michelle Edwards, the winemaker at Cliff Lede Vineyards, says. ''Last harvest on some properties, I removed as much as 10 percent of the grapes off the table because they were desiccated. '' These changes cost money, but they're less costly than allowing wines to carry such alcoholic heat that nobody wants to drink them, and less drastic than abandoning Napa cabernet altogether. Still, the future might include grape varieties that do better in hot weather, like Grenache and Syrah. ''If it keeps getting warmer, maybe we have to think about that,'' Shafer says. ''Maybe cabernet won't always be king here. I have a hard time saying that, but it could be the answer.'

However, neither ''The Dark Side'' nor ''Life With My Sister Madonna'' (stuffed with awful revelations of a different sort) did well enough to knock David Sedaris's ''When You Are Engulfed in Flames'' from the top slot, which it has occupied now for seven weeks. Sedaris's career is among the subjects of another new book, Michael Ian Black's ''My Custom Van: And 50 Other Mind-Blowing Essays That Will Blow Your Mind All Over Your Face,'' which very nearly muscled its way onto the list this week. (It is No. 17 on the extended list.) Sedaris, Black rants, ''writes best-selling book after book, which only goes to prove time and time again that he is capable of greatness and you are not. If that doesn't make you feel bad about yourself, it should. Perhaps you think my antipathy is based on nothing more than good old-fashioned jealousy. You would be right to think this.'' ALL WHITE: Christian Lander's ''Stuff White People Like: The Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions,'' based on his blog, continues to sell well -- it's No. 17 this week on the nonfiction paperback list. One thing on Lander's list (after ''organic food,'' ''Wes Anderson movies'' and ''having black friends'') is, small surprise, writers' workshops. ''It's no secret,'' Lander says: ''White people want to be writers. Why wouldn't they? They could work 10 hours a week from a country house in Maine or New England, get called a genius by other white people and maybe get a book made into a film. Every single white person harbors this dream. No matter what they tell you, all of them have at least one chapter of a novel or memoir stashed away somewhere. Being a marginally crafty race, white people will often seek out every possible route to achieving this goal, and one of the most popular methods has been writers' workshops. These are expensive mini go-to-school-type vacations where you talk with a published writer (often someone you haven't heard of, but they have a book on Amazon), who will tell you how they became a writer. If there is time, they will listen to you read your stuff and tell you that it's good but it needs work on (a) structure, (b) characters or (c) dialogue. Then they will collect their check and go back to their country house or studio apartment in New York.''", "headline": {"main": "TBR: Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 527, "_id": "4fd267ce8eb7c8105d81d376", "snippet": "Christian Lander\u2019s \u201cStuff White People Like\u201d is No. 17 this week on the nonfiction paperback list.

When I finally reach the Battle House hotel in Mobile, the sky is dimming to pink, a salty breeze drifts off the bay, and clouds of swallows dip and swoop past the corniced eves of the surrounding 19th-century cityscape: Gothic churches, Greek Revival buildings and Italianate cast-iron galleries overlooking ribbon-thin streets. Looking westward down Dauphin Street, my back to the Mobile River, I can make out the oak forests of both Bienville and Cathedral Squares. Like Atlanta, Mobile is a city of oaks -- a green canopy that reaches across entire avenues and blots out the sky. The oldest of its trees are in the city's historic center, which rests along the river and is surrounded by the smaller districts of DeTonti Square, Oakleigh Garden, Church Street East and Spring Hill.

Bertoni is a 51-year-old ''semiretired'' computer scientist who lives an hour outside Pittsburgh. In the spring of 2007, his sister-in-law e-mailed him an intriguing bit of news: Netflix, the Web-based DVD-rental company, was holding a contest to try to improve Cinematch, its ''recommendation engine.'' The prize: $1 million. Cinematch is the bit of software embedded in the Netflix Web site that analyzes each customer's movie-viewing habits and recommends other movies that the customer might enjoy. (Did you like the legal thriller ''The Firm''? Well, maybe you'd like ''Michael Clayton.'' Or perhaps ''A Few Good Men.'') The Netflix Prize goes to anyone who can make Cinematch's predictions 10 percent more accurate. One million dollars might sound like an awfully big prize for such a small improvement. But in fact, Netflix's founders tried for years to improve Cinematch, with only incremental results, and they knew that a 10 percent bump would be a challenge for even the most deft programmer. They also knew that, as Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, told me recently, ''getting to 10 percent would certainly be worth well in excess of $1 million'' to the company. The competition was announced in October 2006, and no one has won yet, though 30,000 hackers worldwide are hard at work on the problem. Each day, teams submit their updated solutions to the Netflix Prize Web page, and Netflix instantly calculates how much better than Cinematch they are.
