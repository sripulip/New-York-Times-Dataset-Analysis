[Page A1.] More Patients Move Away From Traditional Health Care Feeling misled or even betrayed, millions of people are venturing outside conventional health care by taking herbal medicine or seeking alternative treatments; the government estimates that such measures add up to annual spending of $27 billion. [A1.] Drug industry executives are voicing new hope that their companies are past the worst of the scientific, political and legal problems that dogged them through 2005. [C1.] Federal spending on the new Medicare drug benefit will be 20 percent lower than expected this year because beneficiaries are choosing prescription drug plans with lower premiums, the Bush administration said. [A20.] Executives of Boston Scientific will meet with regulators from the Food and Drug Administration to discuss quality control problems at some of its factories. The agency has already suspended the company's ability to introduce new products, and the meeting could affect its plans to acquire another medical device maker, Guidant. [C1.] Study Finds Automakers' Design Changes Save Lives Design changes that automakers initially resisted and then reluctantly adopted for sport utility vehicles and pickups have sharply reduced the number of deaths among drivers in cars they hit, according to results from the first such study of the standards. [C1.] Charges Filed Against Former Insurance Executives Three former General Re executives and one former American International Group executive have been charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with a deal that authorities say artificially inflated A.I.G.'s financial position, possibly raising the pressure on other senior executives. [C1.] Amazon's Results Come In Below Expectations Amazon, the online retailer, reported that its profit declined 43 percent during the holiday quarter, in large part because of a decreased tax benefit. A smaller-than-expected increase in revenue, along with high expenses, concerned investors. Amazon's shares declined $3.49, or 8.2 percent, to $39.25 in after-hours trading, after they had fallen in regular trading to close at $42.74. [C2.] The iPod Spawns an Industry for Its Accessories Apple's iPod has given rise to an entire industry in accessories. Sales of cases, docking stations, rechargers and other accessories -- 2,000 at last count -- totaled $850 million last year. [C1.] Image Defied Reality, an Enron Executive Testifies The former Enron chief executives Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay continued to publicize the company's retail energy services division as being successful, even as other top executives knew the unit had suffered huge losses from trading and overpriced contracts, Enron's former head of investor relations testified. [C3.] Similar Goals but Different Routes on Energy President Bush supports the development of ethanol, wind power and other forms of renewable energy. So does Congress. But their goals differ in ways that compete for research dollars and are costing some government researchers their jobs. [A17.] With a tax code that offers more than $1 billion worth of breaks for gasoline and diesel, New York's energy policies show just how hard it will be for the nation to wean itself from foreign oil. [C19.] Retailers Report Their Biggest Sales Gain Since June Retailers reported their biggest monthly sales gain since June, as shoppers redeemed gift cards and bought spring fashions during one of the warmest Januaries on record. [C3.] Workers' Efficiency Increases, but at a Slower Rate The efficiency of American workers rose in 2005 at the slowest pace since the recession year of 2001 while a major gauge of wage pressures rose at the fastest pace in five years, according to a government report. [C3.] General Motors Buys $15 Billion in Technology Services General Motors said it would spend up to $15 billion over the next five years to contract out information technology services. Electronic Data Systems, its former subsidiary, will remain the biggest supplier but will receive a little less work. [C5.] Comcast Posts a Decline in Quarterly Profit The Comcast Corporation, the nation's largest cable company, said profit slid 69 percent in the fourth quarter as investment losses and a higher tax rate offset gains in its core businesses of selling television, high-speed Internet connections and phone service. [C2.] European Bank Paves the Way for a Rate Increase The European Central Bank laid the groundwork for a rate increase next month, its second in five years, saying that Europe was continuing to grow and that inflation remained a threat.

The hiring of Marty Dolan, who covers the insurance industry, continues the trend of large financial conglomerates poaching the traditional investment banks for dealmaking talent.

The classical group could fail. I could screw Westlife's career up. Why am I doing this, because it's going to be quite a high-profile bomb if that happens.''

The car soon disappeared behind an opening marked ''Stage Door,'' a tip surely lost on the fans in attendance, most of whom could not yet read. Then a dozen red-coated dancers skipped brightly from the wings, waving shimmering flags of gold and maroon to the tape-tracked chords of ''Toot Toot Chugga Chugga Big Red Car.'' Close on the dancers' heels and fastened into a real red car with fake seat belts came the Wiggles in the flesh: four Australians otherwise known as Murray Cook, Anthony Field, Jeff Fatt and Greg Page. All wore single-color jerseys with stripe-legged pants and logo-emblazoned belt buckles. ''Toot, toot, chugga, chugga, big red car,'' Page sang in a smooth baritone. ''We'll travel near, and we'll travel far. Toot, toot, chugga, chugga, big red car. We're going to ride the whole day long.''

Sid, a lifelong resident of New York, was the owner of Capitol Distributors Corporation and a former board member of the City Athletic Club. A veteran of World War II, Sid served in the Army artillery, taking part in the Battle of the Bulge, avoiding capture by leading a group of men off the road and into the hills after discerning that the road signs had been reversed by German infiltrators. Sid later joined up with Airborne troops who had liberated Bastogne and, later still, rejoined the artillery units that marched into Germany. A gentle giant of a man, Sid was a superb athlete, avid sportsman, and was once asked to audition for the role of Tarzan, later given to Johnny Weissmuller. As a young man he was an expert rider and starred on the track and field team at DeWitt Clinton High School. Later in life loved deep sea fishing, golf and tennis. Sid loved taking adventuresome trips to places such as the Amazon, China, Africa, the Galapagos, New Zealand, etc. When a family member was not available to accompany him, Sid thought nothing of striking out on an adventure on his own, frequently telling his children that they should live with memories, not regrets. Family was the most important thing in Sid's life. He is survived by his wife of fifty three years, the former Lea Wynperle, as well as his two children, Lawrence Michaels and Leslie Michael Tabet, and their spouses Kathryn Flynn Michaels and Christian Antoine Tabet. In addition, he is survived by his adoring grandchildren Serena Michaels, Sarah-Rose Tabet and Max Tabet. Their loss is profound. Sid is also survived by his sisters, Miriam Schoeneman and Frances Randall, their children and grandchildren, as well as the family of his late brother, Melvin Michaels, with whom he worked in partnership for nearly fifty years. In addition, he is survived by his brotherin-law Bernard Wynperle, his wife Ann, and his mother-inlaw Sara Wynperle, as well as numerous friends and associates. The family also wishes to acknowledge the longtime devotion of the Michael's housekeeper Gloria Ortiz. All our hearts are broken by this unexpected tragedy. Services will be held at 12:45, Tuesday, April 4th, at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

You look at John Terry and you have a deeper understanding of how it was that a small island nation once conquered half the known world. Terry -- the captain of the English Premier League champions, Chelsea, and pillar of his national team's defense -- has the height, the bulk and the air of cold command of the red-coated British sergeant who in days of empire instilled terror in his troops and enemy forces alike. When the two went head-to-head in a game earlier this year, it was more than a clash between two different ways of playing soccer, of approaching life; it was the proverbial case, or so it seemed, of the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object. It happened in March, at a critical moment in last season's clash of European titans, Ronaldinho's Barcelona against Chelsea, in the round of 16 in the Champions League tournament, club soccer's biggest competition. The score was 0-0, and 12 minutes were left in the game. Ronaldinho received the ball in the center of midfield, 15 yards from the Chelsea penalty area. Around him were four Chelsea defenders. Ronaldinho left one of them for dead and avoided two more. The fourth, the last man standing between him and glory, was John Terry. Ronaldinho's response was to do what he does better than anybody else: the unthinkable.

For example, according to Publishers Weekly, Updike's latest book, ''Terrorist,'' has an announced first printing of 150,000 copies. It lists for $25, but Amazon sells it for $15, and new and used copies are available for $12. I can buy one of those $12 copies, pay about $3 in postage, and sell it again on Amazon a few weeks later for just about what I paid for it. Total cost for enjoying Updike's insights and exquisite prose: about $3. The publisher and author are paid for one copy that is read by many individuals for the price of the postage. Thus, as my wife and frequent co-author, Emily, suggests, in the future only 10,000 or fewer copies of most books will ever be printed. The first print run will be the only print run. And thanks to Amazon and the Internet, those copies will endlessly circulate through cyberspace like some sparkling cloud -- a veritable Van Allen belt of books! It's always been difficult to make a living as a writer. The Internet makes it impossible, at least if you insist on sticking to the conventional print paradigm. Alfred Glossbrenner Yardley, Pa. The writer is the author or co-author of approximately 60 books. To the Editor: John Updike's fond remembrance of bookstores throughout his life closely parallels my own. But an alarming, and increasing, number of people do not have any access to bookstores. Nor, for that matter, do they have access to libraries. In these circumstances, how are we to foster a love of reading? How are we to promote literacy? Digital books powered by reliable networks allow us partially to mitigate such circumstances. Digital books offer us a means to reach many people, including children, who would not otherwise have such access. By marrying simple, well understood lessons about networks, search and computer user experiences, we are today providing exemplary kids' literature to places as distant as the rural communities of Mongolia. And our books retain their edges. Tim Browne Manchester by the Sea, Mass. The writer is executive director of the International Children's Digital Library Foundation (www.childrenslibrary.org). To the Editor: The digital book will never replace the printed text as long as there are those who can appreciate the sensual experience of holding a book in their hands, as their eyes, sometimes guided by their fingers, work their way down the page -- pausing when they encounter a particularly complex passage that must be parsed and underscoring each line with a slow-moving finger until all the words coalesce into a thought. My lifelong commitment to books began when I discovered that beyond the circulation desk of the Scranton Public Library lay the stacks, which to me were the equivalent of the Emerald City. It was there that I learned how to hold, sometimes cradle, a book in my hands and lose myself in my discovery. I still wander through the stacks of the library at my university, always learning -- but never learned -- from whatever I take from the shelf, even if I only have time to read a chapter or two. I'm still making contact with something that I can touch, feel and reread without scrolling. Advice to all teachers: Play the Pied Piper and lead your students through the library stacks before they turn virtual. Bernard F. Dick Teaneck, N.J.

Mnookin, who lives in New York but grew up in Boston's suburbs, called himself, in a recent telephone interview, a ''big fan'' of the Sox, but then pulled himself up short. ''Actually, to be considered a 'big fan' of the Sox, you've got to be the kind of person who schedules your annual vacation so you can watch the team play in South Florida,'' he said. ''I'm not quite that kind of fan. I've always loved them, but I'd probably been to 25 games before I began reporting my book.'' Mnookin's previous book was ''Hard News: The Scandals at The New York Times and Their Meaning for the American Media,'' about the fallout from Jayson Blair's fabrications. Interviewing ballplayers is both easier and harder than interviewing journalists, he said. ''Journalists are always apprehensive about being interviewed because they know that a story can change between its conception and its completion.

(Discovery) EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW -- Last month, Gary Hall Jr., the Olympic gold-medal swimmer, successfully fended off a shark until his sister Bebe could kill it with a spear gun, but you may not be so lucky. This special, part of Shark Week, tells how to survive these predators if you don't have an Amazon at your side. At 9, ''Sharks: Are They Hunting Us?'' reveals whether humans have become these predators' favorite cuisine. 8 P.M. (13, 49) LIVE FROM LINCOLN CENTER: MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL 2006 -- Louis Langr\u00e9e (left) conducts a concert fit for a king, or at least a kingly composer, in this 40th-anniversary performance featuring two of Mozart's ''Coronation'' works: the Piano Concerto No. 26, with Garrick Ohlsson, and the Mass in C major, with Hei-Kyung Hong, Sarah Connolly, Matthew Polenzani, John Relyea and the Concert Chorale of New York. Neither work was written for royalty but rather anointed when they were played during the 1791 coronation festivities of Leopold II in Prague, after Mozart's death. 9 P.M. (Fox) SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE -- Is blood thicker than sweat? In tonight's episode, the top six go for the gold, including Heidi Groskreutz and Benji Schwimmer, cousins and former swing-dance champions. But there can be only one winner. 10 P.M. (A&E) CRISS ANGEL MINDFREAK -- Who says you can't go home again? Tonight, Mr. Angel returns to his Long Island high school and plays a few tricks on some teachers without fear of detention. 10 P.M. (FX) 30 DAYS -- Chris Jobin, an American computer programmer who lost his employment to outsourcing, wants his job back. In this episode, he travels to India to see the effects of jobs from the United States on the country and attends seminars on perfecting American accents (above, with Mr. Jobin, center) -- and finds out why his already-perfect accent wasn't perfect enough.

THE NETWORK EQUIPMENT MAKER Brocade Communications Systems agreed to pay $713 million for a smaller rival, the McData Corporation, in an all-stock deal.

Net income rose to $458.7 million, from $161.5 million a year earlier. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) A METAL PRODUCTS MAKER, Aleris International, agreed to be acquired for $1.7 billion by an equity firm, the Texas Pacific Group.

American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. A1 The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.'' A6 Tsunami Project Stalled Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started. A8 Hints at Need for Iraq Change James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria. A1 American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months. A8 Japan and China Mend Fences China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined. A3 Iran Opposition Cleric Seized Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them. A3 Transponder Not Recalled The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said. A9 NATIONAL A10-15 Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. A1 Virginia Republicans Resolute In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents. A1 For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year. A12 Races Hinge on Local Economy Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one. A10 Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case. A10 Fight Over National Park Hunt Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December. A15 Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said. A10 Senator's Finances Questioned For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Despite Criticism at Home, Giuliani Retains Support Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is scheduled to make his first public appearance in two years in New Hampshire. Yet as Mr. Giuliani traverses the country, polls show he has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential primaries -- largely because of how he guided a wounded city in the weeks after 9/11. B1 Cluster of Sex Offenders A house where four sex offenders lived together as roommates has caused an uproar in Suffolk County, where one Suffolk County lawmaker has called for legislation to prevent groups of registered sex offenders from living together. B1 A Mall of Knockoffs In the last two years, the city has seized close to $50 million in counterfeit goods from the city's top haven for knockoff and phony goods, and shut down 15 buildings that it claimed were once occupied almost entirely by counterfeiters, but thousands of people still pack the area on weekends. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-10 Steinbrenner Silent on Torre George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is fuming over the team's first-round elimination by the Detroit Tigers. He issued a blistering statement through his publicist but took no action on Joe Torre, his manager for the last 11 seasons. D1 Ugly Finish at Talladega Brian Vickers won the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, after pushing his teammate Jimmie Johnson's car into Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the backstretch of the last lap. D9 ARTS E1-10 Unlikely Success at Book Fair A book by the American author Jonathan Littell, ''Les Bienveillantes,'' has taken the Frankfurt fair, the world's largest booksellers' convention, by storm. Written in French, the novel features an unrepentant Nazi SS officer as the hero and could command $1 million, publishers say. E1 OBITUARIES B9 David G. Salten An innovative and influential educator who devised a desegregation plan for the New Rochelle, N.Y., school system and, as an expert witness in 1958, urged the immediate opening of the newly integrated schools in Little Rock, Ark., he was 93. B9 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 Restructuring Airbus Discussions over who would ultimately make decisions regarding the restructuring at Airbus continued over the weekend, and executives close to the talks said that the chief executive, M. Christian Streiff, could resign if he does not secure the autonomy that he wants. C1 New Season on Network TV The new network television season has three new shows that are giving early signs of being winners: ''Heroes'' on NBC, ''Jericho'' on CBS and ''Ugly Betty'' on ABC. But on the down side, several new shows have already been dropped. C1 OPEC May Cut Production A consensus among OPEC members began to form about cuts in oil production to help stem the decline in price, but the group's members have not yet agreed on how to share the reduced output.

Cohen, for once saying something nice about his books; to Paris Hilton, for belonging to a family whose hotel chain carries them in gift shops; and to Don DeLillo and Joan Didion, whose names appear before and after his in almanacs and lists of American writers.

The resurgence of these executives is the immediate outgrowth of the major studios' plans to cut back on releases. Private investors, who were previously making deals with the studios, are now turning to old industry hands to fill the void. But there's another major reason for the shift in Wall Street's interest from the studios to these at-large executives: lackluster results from investments in big studio releases.

[C8.] YAHOO DEAL WITH NEWSPAPERS -- A consortium of seven newspaper chains representing 176 daily papers across the country is announcing a broad partnership with Yahoo to share content, advertising and technology online in an attempt to increase traffic and revenues at both the No. 1 Internet portal and the newspapers' own Web sites. For the newspapers, the deal represents an effort to capture a larger portion of the fast-growing dollars spent online on classified and other ads. [C1.] THE JUDGE AND THE NEWSPAPER -- In 1983, a Supreme Court justice in Pennsylvania sued The Philadelphia Inquirer for defamation. The case was dismissed this summer -- 23 years after it began. Now another case of a judge suing a newspaper for defamation has started up the legal chain. Three years ago, the chief justice of the Supreme Court in Illinois sued The Kane County Chronicle, a 14,000-circulation daily west of Chicago. Last week, the justice won the first round, with a jury finding that a former Chronicle columnist had written falsely and acted with malice in accusing the justice of trading a vote. The jury awarded the justice $7 million. The Chronicle plans to appeal. [C4.] OUTRAGE OVER SIMPSON -- Showing that attempts at corporate synergy can sometimes backfire, several affiliates of Fox Broadcasting said that they would not air the network's two-part interview with O.J. Simpson next week. The much-hyped interview, to be broadcast Nov. 27 and 29, will coincide with the Nov. 30 release of Mr. Simpson's book, ''If I Did It.'' According to Judith Regan, who is both publishing the book and conducting the interview, the book is Mr. Simpson's confession to the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, for which he was acquitted in 1994. [C8.] GETTING THE JEANS TO FIT -- For all its innovations, the Internet has yet to crack what is, for many, one of life's most vexing problems: how to find jeans that won't make your backside look like a tractor trailer. A new online business, Zafu.com, believes that it has made progress on that front. Unlike, say, Amazon -- which analyzes a visitor's browsing and buying behavior and recommends merchandise bought by others with similar behavior -- Zafu's approach relies on users to do a little of the work. On the site, which is basically a search engine for clothes, visitors click through a questionnaire of about a dozen items, after which Zafu determines the visitor's body type and displays what it believes are the best-fitting jeans to suit that visitor. Robert Holloway, Zafu's chief executive, above, said the service had been about two years in the making. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C12.] RATING ISSUES AT FOX -- In most recent years, Fox has been the split-personality network. But never has the disparity been as stark as it has this television season, when the lamb has been led to the slaughter every week. From almost every ratings standpoint, Fox is in the midst of a dismal run. The network is last in almost every audience category, even in areas of traditional Fox strength, like viewers ages 18 to 34. [C1.] GAME AND TELEVISION -- Telemedia InteracTV Productions has used the new genre of interactive television to urge viewers to call in and play simple games in hopes of winning some money, while at the same time helping to spur an industry whose advertising revenues are shrinking. While the format has existed in several countries since 2001, Telemedia's founder and chairman, Jeno Torocsik, hopes to become the genre's baron with a new business model. [C4.] UPDATING THE SEAL -- Good Housekeeping, owned by the Hearst Corporation, is undergoing a broad-based effort to overhaul the image of its century-old brand. Good Housekeeping Research Institute, the updated version of the magazine's test lab, will play a crucial role because in a bit of circular self-promotion, no product can earn the seal or advertise in the magazine unless it passes the lab's tests, and advertisers using the seal must agree to buy a minimum number of ad pages, typically as much as they would buy in Good Housekeeping's rivals. [C1.] FROM TV INTO A MAGAZINE -- The December issue of FHM magazine carries the first installment of a campaign that seeks to translate into print the series of ''man laws'' commercials for Miller Lite beer. The FHM print campaign was selected after a competition that pitted ideas from the magazine's ad sales department against those submitted by their counterparts at several men's magazines. As is becoming increasingly common as magazines battle the new media for ad dollars, the campaign involves elements that extend beyond ad pages. Advertising, Stuart Elliott.

Eric Houston's solo comedy about the coming of age of a Brooklynite (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. 'EXTRAORDINARY DECEPTIONS: A MAGICAL HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA' Starts performances on Tuesday. Get sawed in half at this holiday magic show (1:00). Lion Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4100. 'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway 'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's ''Home'' -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) * 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell) 'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820. (Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'NEVER MISSED A DAY' A well-observed and sometimes funny play about a group of co-workers who are giving their souls to the company, and one who has lived to regret it. A good cast brings the characters to life, but their common beef against an unseen boss offers little in the way of conflict (1:30). The WorkShop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Monday. (Genzlinger) 'FLOYD AND CLEA UNDER THE WESTERN SKY' Floyd and Clea are two country-western singers who strike up an oddball friendship in this gentle but seriously sentimental two-person musical, written by and starring David Cale (1:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'HIGH FIDELITY' This bland musical adaptation of the popular book and movie of the same title erases itself from your memory even as you watch it. Walter Bobbie directs a cast led by the affable and smooth Will Chase (2:00). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza Strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'OPEN DOOR' Federico Restrepo and Loco 7's ''dance puppet music odyssey'' about the joys of immigration is striking and evocative, even if some specific messages aren't altogether clear (1:10). La MaMa E.T.C. (Annex Theater), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Gates) 'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'TWO SEPTEMBER' Mac Wellman calls a halt to his usual brainy wordplay in this surprisingly sober (and rather dry) historical drama that tells two tangentially related stories. The journalist Josephine Herbst recalls her struggles duing the blacklist years, while Ho Chi Minh meets with United States officials in 1945 to seek their aid in forming a new country from the ruins of postwar Indochina (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott) * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (Scott) 'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and discusses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis) 'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis) 'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott) 'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis) 'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz) 'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw, ''Like father, like son,'' are the thematic heart of this third installment of the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Holden) * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott) * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott) 'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden) * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott) 'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden) 'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott) 'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis) 'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Catsoulis) 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden) * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 2:10 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott) 'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis) 'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott) 'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott) 'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis) * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden) 'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis) 'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over.

CORINNE BAILEY RAE, KEVIN DEVINE (Tonight) Even when she is griping that love is ''a type of loan with no dividends,'' it is hard not to be seduced by Ms. Bailey Rae, a 27-year-old British singer and guitarist who is this year's breakout soul star. In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' Mr. Devine, once of the band Miracle of 86, has carved out a niche as a singer-songwriter in the Elliott Smith mold. At 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, housingworks.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario) BOGMEN (Thursday) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and the occasional funk rhythm. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-day revival begins Thursday at Webster Hall. At 8 p.m., 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario) CHAVEZ (Tomorrow) Did somebody say '90s New York alt-rock reunion? A decade ago Chavez's hefty, dissonant guitars and shy vocals fit right in with the music of Pavement, Archers of Loaf and Sebadoh. Now, with a new double album, ''Better Days Will Haunt You'' (Matador), collecting the complete works of the band -- it lasted only three years -- Chavez returns for this concert at Warsaw. Also on the bill is the aptly named Endless Boogie. At 8 p.m., 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15. (Sisario) CHEETAH GIRLS (Thursday) Behold the new teenage pop: it is female, its reference points are sexed-up strutters like the Pussycat Dolls and Christina Aguilera, and it has the Disney seal of approval. The Cheetah Girls began as a Disney Channel movie, and the group's latest album (the soundtrack to the sequel) opened in the Top 5. With Everlife. At 7 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $26.50 to $42.

(Sisario) MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Wednesday) Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970s styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. With Matt Keating. At 8 p.m., the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Jon Pareles) * THE EX (Tonight) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Civil War with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Arbouretum and DJ/rupture. At 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $12. (Sisario) * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night, Tuesday through Thursday) The strongest incarnation so far of the singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. At 8:30 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) GOGOL BORDELLO (Thursday) With an untamed stage persona a bit like Iggy Pop and a bit like a paranoid Kafka protagonist, the singer-contortionist Eugene Hutz leads a cultural mash-up of dirty punk, raucous Gypsy music and vaudevillian theatrics. The band has been playing like there's no tomorrow for years now and shows no signs of slowing down or even taking a breath. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) GOOD FOR THE JEWS (Tonight) The tree has been lighted in Rockefeller Center and the department-store window displays have gone up, which means that it's time for the annual ritual of comedians and rockers musing on the true meaning of being Jewish at Christmas. Among the witty reindeer joining the band Good for the Jews for this Hanukkah concert are the singers Lisa Loeb, Tammy Faye Starlite and Julian Fleisher, and the comedians Todd Barry and Rachel Feinstein.

(Sisario) JOE LALLY (Tomorrow) Mr. Lally's smooth, muscular bass lines steadied the sound of Fugazi, the alt-rock granddaddies from Washington.

At 8:30 p.m., Lit Lounge, 92 Second Avenue, at Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987, litloungenyc.com; $6. (Sisario) RAY LAMONTAGNE (Tomorrow) A master of the breathy, apologetic croon, Mr. LaMontagne, a former shoe factory worker in Maine, has risen fast in the world of hypersensitive young singer-songwriters. His songs about ''trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble'' have also begun to dent the pop world, with cover versions by the ''American Idol'' winners Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Hicks. Also on the bill is Tristan Prettyman. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 13 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with clever but usually over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Mr. John. At 7 and 9, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25.

Opening the shows are Mr. Lif and the Coup tomorrow, Ben Kweller on Sunday and John Brown's Body on Tuesday.

(Sisario) THE NEW DEAL (Tonight) Jam bands and electronic dance music usually call for different beats and different wardrobes, but their goal is the same: to make dancers happy with open-ended grooves. The New Deal brings both camps together, using human muscle to approximate computerized breakbeats. With Benzos. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $28. (Pareles) POPA CHUBBY (Tonight) Popa Chubby hails from the Bronx, but his heart is in steamy, rambunctious Chicago blues and its 1960s-rock spinoffs. In a gruff voice, he sings about characters like a ''sweet goddess of love and beer''; his guitar solos coil and bite. With Irving Louis Lattin. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30. (Pareles) * RAINER MARIA (Tomorrow and Sunday) For a decade, this earnest and literate trio, which began in Madison, Wis., and moved to Brooklyn, could be counted on for big, urgent cries that sounded just a bit louder than the players were comfortable with (and that's not always a bad thing). Last month it announced that it would be disbanding, and these are its last concerts in New York. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Pela and Daylight's for the Birds, at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

(Sisario) SAM CHAMPION (Tonight) This local four-piece derives its shambolic jangle from Pavement, singing about being ''aggressively lazy''; the aggression comes in tense jabs of guitar that recall Neil Young. With Brian Bonz. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario) OUMOU SANGARE (Tomorrow) Ms. Sangare comes from the Wassoulou section of Mali, where women have a tradition of singing to entertain and instruct. Her group plays circular, triple-time vamps -- griot music tinged with funk -- as her voice soars above them, smooth and impassioned; backup singers spur her onward and dance, tossing bowls in the air. At 7:30 p.m., Aaron Davis Hall, City College, Convent Avenue at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7289, carnegiehall.org; free, but tickets are required.

(Many other stations around the country have similar shows.) Playing short sets for Z100 (WHTZ-FM) -- er, for fans, that is -- are Evanescence, the Killers, Nelly Furtado, the Fray, Nick Lachey, Rihanna, the Pussycat Dolls and RBD.

MOSE ALLISON (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Allison is best known for his songs, which combine cosmopolitan wit with a folksy worldview.

(Chinen) CHRIS BOTTI (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Botti is a trumpeter whose photogenic style and brooding sensuality suit current notions of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. But his low-gloss polish is generally likable, and he tends to stretch out a bit with his first-rate band. (Through Dec. 24.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $50 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) FATBLASTER (Tonight) A confab of adventurous trumpeters, representing three levels of experience: Ralph Alessi, an accomplished leader and educator; Shane Endsley, a prominent recent arrival; and Eric Biondo, who seems most likely to have been behind the prankish name. The saxophonist Loren Stillman and the guitarist Ryan Ferreira fill out the group, so to speak. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $10.

At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) LASZLO GARDONY (Tonight) On his most recent album, ''Natural Instinct'' (Sunnyside), Mr. Gardony matches his fluid pianism with a rhythmic undercurrent created by John Lockwood on bass and Yoron Israel on drums.

(Chinen) * ROBERT GLASPER TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Robert Glasper is a pianist given to silvery flourishes and gospel intimations, though his deepest commitment is to the swirl of his trio with the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Damion Reid.

(Chinen) * CEDAR WALTON (Tonight through Sunday; Tuesday through Thursday) As a pianist and composer Mr. Walton pursues an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard bop. This weekend he leads his superb trio, with David Williams on bass and Lewis Nash on drums; next week they become a quartet with the addition of Vincent Herring, a fluent force on alto saxophone. (Through Dec. 24.) At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, $25 tonight and tomorrow, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Tomorrow his Mim\u00ec is Maija Kovalevska, the Latvian soprano who was one of the first-prize winners in the 2006 Operalia Competition, which Pl\u00e1cido Domingo runs for young singers. Anna Samuil is Musetta, and Peter Coleman-Wright ably sings her jealous lover, Marcello. Steven Crawford conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $220 tickets remaining. (Vivien Schweitzer) * 'DON CARLO' (Monday) The powerhouse tenor Johan Botha is a hefty man and a stiff actor. But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role of Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlo,'' in John Dexter's production. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts a magnificent performance. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Thursday) A rare sighting: new opera at the Met. Tan Dun's East-West fusion promises all the bells and whistles of a grand opera spectacle. Let's hope for the music too. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland) 'M\u00c9D\u00c9E' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Call it garage opera. The Vertical Player Repertory performs in a small Brooklyn factory-turned-studio but has developed a following for its intense performances of unusual works. Darius Milhaud's ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e,'' the last opera performed in Paris before the Nazi occupation, was so successful in November the company has brought it back for three more performances. At 8, Vertical Player Repertory, 219 Court Street, at Warren Street, Brooklyn Heights, (212) 539-2696, vpropera.org; $25. (Anne Midgette) 'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos \u00c1lvarez has taken over the title role of Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' in the Met's revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production. Of special interest is the emerging Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja as the rakish Duke. Tuesday brings the Met debut in that role of a young Polish tenor, Piotr Beczala. Friedrich Haider conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets remaining tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tonight and Wednesday) The revival of Julie Taymor's whimsical production of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' continues tonight. Isabel Bayrakdarian uses her clear, expressive voice in a radiant portrayal of Pamina, while Nathan Gunn is a winningly animated Papageno. The rest of the cast, conducted by James Levine, includes Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night, Robert Lloyd as the Speaker, Stephen Milling as Sarastro and Christoph Strehl as Tamino. Fanciful puppets provide plenty of visual stimulation. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $205 to $375 tickets remaining tonight, Wednesday $80 to $175. (Schweitzer) Classical Music AXIOM (Thursday) New and recent music at Juilliard is no longer a one-party system: last year, the New Juilliard Ensemble was joined by Axiom, a student-run ensemble devoted to 20th-century repertory. This week the group offers an orthodox, appealing concert of several titans: Xenakis, Stockhausen and Boulez, along with Milhaud's jazz ballet ''La Cr\u00e9ation du Monde'' and Frederic Rzewski's ''Moutons de Panurge,'' which starts with the whole ensemble playing a single tune and degenerates like a game of ''Operator.'' Jeffrey Milarsky conducts. At 8 p.m., Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Midgette) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Tonight at this intimate floating chamber music hall, Olga Vinokur, a pianist, offers a robustly Romantic program, with Beethoven's Sonata No. 10, Chopin's Sonata No. 2, Medtner's ''Canzona Matinata'' and Rachmaninoff's \u00c9tudes-Tableaux (Op. 39). Prokofiev's ''Sarcasms'' add a touch of early contemporary spice. Tomorrow and Sunday a clarinet trio -- Julian Bliss, clarinetist; Julien Quentin, pianist; and Eric Jacobsen, cellist -- play the Brahms Trio in A minor and works by Prokofiev, Bernstein, Berg and Bloch. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30; Sunday at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35, $20 for students, $30 for 65+ tonight only. (Allan Kozinn) BALTIMORE CONSORT (Sunday) This superb medieval and Renaissance quintet offers a Christmas program as part of the Music Before 1800 series. Included are carols and dances from England, France, Germany and Spain. For the vocal works, the ensemble is joined by Jos\u00e9 Lemos, a countertenor, and Danielle Svonavec, a soprano. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40, $5 off for students and 65+.

Tonight, the violinist Ani Kavafian performs Bach's violin sonatas accompanied by Kenneth Cooper on harpsichord and fortepiano. Tomorrow, Colin Carr plays Bach's cello suites. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Society stays true to its annual holiday tradition with a concert of Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos.

(Schweitzer) * ETHEL (Sunday and Thursday) The indie, rock-infused, postclassical string band Ethel, which has been drawing audiences to its gigs at Joe's Pub, has another date there on Sunday evening, a collaboration with the self-described ''pixie songstress'' Jill Sobule. On Thursday, Ethel invites one and all to celebrate the winter solstice at the World Financial Center's Winter Garden with a performance of its site-specific, multimedia, semi-installation, quasi-theatrical concert piece ''In the House of Ethel.'' Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Tommasini) * REN\u00c9E FLEMING, orchestra of st. luke's (Thursday) ''Rejoice Greatly: Christmas With Ren\u00e9e Fleming'' is the title of a holiday program with the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Carnegie Hall. High-minded concertgoers tempted to roll their eyes at this event should remember that great divas past like Anna Moffo, Eileen Farrell and Joan Sutherland gave Christmas concerts and made Christmas recordings. Moreover, this program has some musically rich and substantive offerings, including arias from oratorios and cantatas by Handel, Mozart and Bach, songs by Bernstein and Reger, instrumental works by Berlioz and Korngold, and the requisite Christmas carols, not to mention Leroy Anderson's jaunty orchestral piece ''Sleigh Ride,'' which, admit it, everyone loves. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $45 to $125. (Tommasini) MUSICA SACRA CHORUS AND ORCHESTRA (Wednesday) The venerable Musica Sacra under Richard Westenburg continues its long-lived tradition of Handel's ''Messiah'' at Carnegie Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $120. (Holland) * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) David Robertson, the intellectually curious and technically adept conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, visits the Philharmonic with a compelling program built around the United States premiere of the ''Adriana Songs'' by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho, a cycle based on her new opera, ''Adriana Mater.'' The mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon is the soloist. Also on the program are two Debussy works, ''La Mer'' and excerpts from ''Le Martyre de St. S\u00e9bastien,'' and Sibelius's ''Night Ride and Sunrise.'' At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Kozinn) ORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Monday) Early-music specialists may slim down their ''Messiahs,'' but the Victorians liked their Handel large and loud, and this venerable amateur chorus keeps that particular flame alive: it has sung ''Messiah'' at Carnegie Hall every year but one since the hall opened in 1891. Kent Tritle, a widely respected organist and choral conductor who is almost as ubiquitous as ''Messiah'' itself on New York stages, took over the group's leadership last year, and will conduct. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $17 to $75. (Midgette) TRINITY CHOIR (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Messiahs'' in the New York holiday season are as ubiquitous as Salvation Army Santas. But Trinity Church offers one of the city's best. It features the relatively lean forces of its own choir, suitable to the smallish church, and the Rebel Baroque Orchestra, all conducted by the choir's director, Owen Burdick. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday at 6 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, (866) 468-7619, trinitywallstreet.org; $30 to $50. (Midgette) VIENNA CHOIR BOYS (Sunday) Founded in 1498 and counting Haydn, Schubert and the conductor Hans Richter among their illustrious graduates, the Vienna Choir Boys are still going strong. Here the talented young musicians, with pure, treble voices, offer a program of ''spiritual music'' from around the world, including a 13th-century Gregorian chorale, Mozart's ''Ave Verum Corpus,'' Charles Hubert Hastings Parry's ''Jerusalem,'' an Uzbek folk tune, a Peruvian/Quechuan hymn and Andy Icochea Icochea's ''Psalm 61.'' At 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $19 to $70. (Schweitzer) WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Daniel Barenboim's mixed youth orchestra from Israel, Middle Eastern Arab countries and Spain practices its musical metaphor for peace and cooperation with music by Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $48. (Holland) OXANA YABLONSKAYA (Tonight) The Chopin Society of New York presents an all-Chopin evening with this pianist. She will be joined by the cellist Dmitry Yablonsky, the soprano Inna Dukach and the flutist Sarah Brady. The program includes the Grand Duo on themes from Meyerbeer's ''Robert le Diable'' for flute and piano, four songs, five mazurkas, the Cello Sonata (Op. 65) and the ''Polonaise Brillante.'' At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35, $15 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) This vibrant company's annual season has two highlights this week, along with the revolving programs of mostly stellar repertory, most of which include ''Revelations.'' On Sunday night the program will celebrate Renee Robinson's 25th anniversary as an Ailey dancer, with two items -- ''Grace'' and an excerpt from ''Sweet Bitter Love'' -- that can be seen only that night. And Tuesday will mark the first performance of the revival of ''Pas de Duke'' in its original duet form, after the one-shot version with three couples seen at the season-opening gala. Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell) Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tuesday through Thursday) The Trocks, as fans call this long-established group, are men in tights -- and tutus and pointe shoes. They can be very funny, but they have also won a reputation for real technical ability and knowledgeable restagings of ballet classics. Highlights of the two programs on offer this year are L\u00e9onide Massine's ''Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne,'' created for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, and Jerome Robbins's ''Cage,'' a chilling portrait of a female devouring its male prey that should be perfect fodder for this company. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30, Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44, $33 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) CAMILLA BROWN AND DANCERS (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Brown, who aims at spiritual flight in dance grounded in modern, ballet and West African forms, will present her own work and dances by Darrell Moultrie and Roger C. Jeffrey. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street between Houston and Spring Streets, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $20, $15 for students. (Dunning) DANCE AND PROCESS: DANIEL LINEHAN, MELANIE MAAR AND JILLIAN PE\u00d1A (Wednesday and Thursday) The three choreographers, chosen by Miguel Gutierrez, show work developed over a seven-week group process of shared creation. Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $10. (Dunning) DANCE AT DIXON PLACE (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Jody Oberfelder will offer a preview of new work (tomorrow), and Marcia Monroe's ''Crossing Boundaries'' series will feature dance by Marija Krtolica, Sally Hess, the Roosters, Moeno Wakamutsu and Amos Pinhasi (Tuesday). At 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $12, $10 for students (tomorrow) and $12 or TDF (free) (Tuesday). (Dunning) LIZ GERRING DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) A spare movement vocabulary drawn from natural gesture forms the basis of ''when you lose something you can't replace,'' a collaboration with the artist Burt Barr. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15. (Anderson) SCOTTY HERON AND HIJACK (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Heron is a performer of irresistible, fearless and eloquent illogic. Hijack is a dance duo (Kristin Van Loon and Arwen Wilder) from Minneapolis. The three will perform in ''Stacked, Double Cow,'' which shares the bill with a piece called ''3 Minutes of Pork and Shoving.'' At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $10 for members. (Dunning) JUILLIARD DANCE DIVISION (Tonight through Sunday) The entire division will perform in a program of new works created for them by David Parker, Matthew Neenan, Doug Varone and Aszure Barton. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Dunning) * MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Tonight through Sunday) ''The Hard Nut,'' Mr. Morris's affectionate, off-kilter, 1970s disco-style version of this classic, still set to Tchaikovsky's wonderful score, will return to this area for four performances at the flashy Frank Gehry-designed Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College. Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Sosnoff Theater in the Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, bard.edu/fishercenter; $25 to $65. (Rockwell) Richard Move/MoveOpolis! (Tuesday through Thursday) Richard Move is best known for channeling Martha Graham, but he also makes more serious dance-theater pieces. This program is a chance to see some of his older works in this vein, as well as ''Toward the Delights of the Exquisite Corpse,'' first shown at the Jacob's Pillow festival this summer. It combines several famous talents -- the visual artist Charles Atlas, the writer Hilton Als, the designer Patricia Fields -- and a bunch of talented dancers. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $25; $15 for artists, members, students and 65+. (Sulcas) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and the stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Sunday afternoon will offer a cast full of younger dancers in their roles for the first time, including Ana Sophia Scheller as the Sugarplum Fairy, Tyler Angle as her Cavalier and Sara Mearns as Dewdrop. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell) NEW YORK THEATER BALLET (Tomorrow and Sunday) The company's production of ''The Nutcracker,'' choreographed by Keith Michael, is childlike and just an hour long. Tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $30; $25 for children 12 and under. (Dunning) PARSONS DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) David Parsons brings his high-energy company to the Joyce with two programs performed over two weeks. Highlights include ''The Nascimento Project,'' a new collaboration with the Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento; a revival of ''Ring Around the Rosie,'' last seen in New York more than a decade ago; and ''In the End,'' set to music by the Dave Matthews Band. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (La Rocco) * SARAH SAVELLI (Tonight) There is only one night to see Ms. Savelli, an Ohio dancer whom the tap diva Jane Goldberg describes as the Barbra Streisand of tap, in a program with guests including Ayodele Casel. Tonight at 7:30, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $25. (Dunning) STREB SLAM (Tonight through Sunday) Elizabeth Streb and her fearless (we hope) high-flying, hard-crashing performers will present a new show, ''Streb SLAM 8: Extreme Action,'' complete with popcorn and cotton candy. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., SLAM, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $15; $10 for children 12 and under. (Dunning) 'TRIBUTE TO BUTOH' CELESTE HASTINGS AND MOENO WAKAMATSU (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Hastings, whose work blends dance, theater and Butoh, takes four women's dreams of the Amazon jungles as her metaphor in ''Amazonas.'' And Ms. Wakamatsu, who began her professional career in architecture, draws from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' in this program honoring Butoh on the 100th birthday of Kazuo Ohno, a pioneer of the Japanese dance and theater form. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, CRS Center, 123 Fourth Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village, (212) 677-8621, crsny.org; $15, $10 for students. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums American Folk Art Museum: 'A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,' through Jan. 7. Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Mr. Brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes for Mr. Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio) * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did on subject in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck) * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over humble brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) * New-York Historical Society: 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery,' through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the '60s, a century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size, first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart and a luscious still life of a steak and with a cabbage and a carrot by Raphaelle Peale (1816-17) are distinguished entries from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, through Dec. 29. (Glueck) * JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 22. (Smith) * 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed, ranging from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, ''Portrait of a Bearded Man'' (1530-35) is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788), by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through Feb. 9. (Glueck) Sigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman) Galleries: SoHo SLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works by this 31-year old artist. In ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Genocchio) Galleries: Chelsea Nathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests that they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335; caseykaplangallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Martha Schwendener) CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Dec. 22. (Smith) * GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary ''specific objects'' by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, through Dec. 23. (Smith) * TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously-made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on ''Moby-Dick.'' He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, through Dec. 23. (Smith) Last Chance LUCIAN FREUD The latest efforts of this British painter conform to a certain Freudian formula. Whether nudes or portraits, most paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and the continuous effort on the painter's part to get things right. As usual there are occasional forays into the outside world and a rather startling self-portrait. ''The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer'' shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed) poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-6300, closes Wednesday. (Smith) * Richard Hamilton This British artist, born in 1922, is famous for having coined the term Pop Art and for pioneering the aesthetic it defined. Yet he remains little known here. The Dickinson and Roundell show is his first New York career survey since 1973. Given its small scale, it can't help but be a scrappy affair, but it is a piece of history. Dickinson Roundell, 19 East 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 772-8083, closes today. (Cotter) Paul Lee Queer coding has long been a protective necessity, a cultural binder and a source of pleasure, in art no less than in life. Paul Lee, born in London and in his early 30s, explores it in his fragile sculptures and gently prods its mechanisms without fully exposing or demythologizing them. He gives us the props associated with erotically charged environments -- back rooms, baths, parks -- but also preserves a quality of hiddenness, mystery. Massimo Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, No. 519, Chelsea, (212) 675-9082 , massimoaudiello.com, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN.' From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum, closes tomorrow. (Smith) ARIC OBROSEY In these fastidious graphite drawings of woven and knotted threads, all the strands behave according to strict spatial and structural rules, even as they coalesce at the center into mandala-like circles or a wildly knotted disco ball. As they twist and turn they also evoke different cultures, materials and crafts. Care in making encourages care in looking. McKenzie Fine Art Inc., 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5467, closes Wednesday. (Smith) Jeff Perrone Mr. Perrone was a charter member of Pattern and Decoration, the 1970s movement that officially turned craft into art and elevated visual extravagance to a high place. Compared to the ornamental painting and fabric pieces he is best known for, though, the work in this show is Minimalist plain: 46 small earthenware plaques hung edge-to-edge in a row, each painted flat turquoise blue with modest yellow border designs and hand-printed texts, manyof them bitingly topical. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-9156, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images in this show are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and governmental corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, who is famous for having painted 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for the Afrobeat idol and political rebel Fela Kuti. For the occasion, Mr. Ghariokwu also introduces two of his younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, closes Sunday.
