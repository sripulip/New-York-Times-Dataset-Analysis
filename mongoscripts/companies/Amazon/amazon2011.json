He is survived by his companion of many years, Nancy McBride Hogg. Gerald is also survived by his cousin Page Davis Ikard of Connecticut and by former wife Jean C. Keating of Williamsburg, VA. Gerald was a world expert on planetary atmospheres. He studied the Aeronomy of planetary atmospheres generally at altitudes above 100km where escape of the planetary atmosphere begins to occur. His experiments have been flown to Venus (Pioneer Venus and Magellan), Mars (Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), and Earth (Explorers 9, 19, 24, and 39). For Earth, he discovered the Winter Helium Bulge and the Cooling of the Thermosphere due to increases in CO2. At Venus, he discovered a cryosphere in the upper atmosphere and also detected the super-rotation of the upper atmosphere. In the upper atmosphere of Mars he discovered a winter polar warming of the thermosphere, determined exospheric temperatures regulating escape of the planetary atmosphere, mapped the thermosphere as a function of local solar time, latitude, season, and solar activity, detected enormous increases in the thermospheric density caused by dust storms and discovered planetary scale waves that cause variation in thermospheric density by a factor of two. He and his colleagues showed the first compelling evidence of the response of the Earth's ozone layer to solar variability. Recently he discovered strong greenhouse cooling in the Earth's thermosphere caused by the global rise of anthropogenic CO2. Some of his last ideas reflected the cooling vs heating of the atmosphere debate. Both are happening in a simultaneous fashion. The outer atmos- phere is cooling and shrinking as a result of CO2 build-up. The Ion layer shrinks and drops, gets thicker, deflects CO2 back to the surface which makes the near-surface atmosphere get thicker and hotter. The outer atmosphere shrinking was important to Gerald because that's where satellites fly. The decrease in density in the outer atmosphere affects satellite orbits. Gerald went directly to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Hampton, VA after schooling as a Physicist. Bitten by the \"space bug\" in the form of Sputnik 1, there was no other place he wanted to work. At NASA Langley, he received the top NASA award for scientific studies, the Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement; the NASA Langley Award for the \"most outstanding paper\" of 1974, the H.J. E. Reid Award; plus a number of other awards for various discoveries. As a teenager, Gerald invented an adaptation to the popcorn machine at Woolworth's that eliminated the \"widows\" (un-popped kernels) from the bags of popcorn sold at that chain. At the beginning of his career, he figured out the orbital mechanics for the first US communications satellite. He said he \"got extra points for doing a 'dogleg' over Moscow to hear what the Russians were saying.\" Gerald retired from NASA Langley in 1995. Until his death, he was a Senior Staff Research Scientist at The George Washington University. After retiring from NASA, Gerald took about four months to decide he really could not play golf and he was bored. He chose The George Washington University to continue his search for discoveries. While at GWU, Gerald was Principal Investigator/Team Leader for the accelerometer experiments on MGS, MO and MRO. Gerald was the first author of the Mars Thermosphere Planetary Quarantine Model for the Viking Extended Mission. He developed the thermospheric model for the Venus International Reference Atmosphere. This VIRA model was used for Magellan aerobraking and for Pioneer Venus Operations. He was responsible for generating The International Reference Atmosphere of the Earth's Ozone for COSPAR. COSPAR is the International Committee for Space Research established by the International Council of Scientific Unions. He was Chairman of COSPAR'S Sub-commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Aeronomy and Chairman of COSPAR's Task Group on Reference Atmospheres of Trace Species. He headed the Mars International Reference Atmosphere. His bibliography includes more than 150 publications. Gerald was an adventurer, photographer and dare-devil. For many winters, he went skiing down the black diamond slopes of the Matterhorn, in Switzerland. He liked to tell people he \"had been to over 100 countries and two other planets.\" For a month, in the 1960's, he explored and traveled down, by canoe type boat, the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, near where it connects to the Amazon River. Around that time frame, he once, in Peru, bribed (with liquor) a crop duster to fly him over Machu Picchu - an illegal act at the time - so he could look and take pictures. He also, in a similar fashion, got a flight to look at the glyphs in Chile. He took an eye-level (in a bit larger airplane) photo of Mount Everest. One stunt, even he admitted was foolhardy, was taking a picture of a tiger in a zoo in India while being on the same side of the fence as the tiger. In India, Gerald photographed the Taj Mahal, went to Tiger Tops and Lake Dahl. He went on safari in Africa. He got to Mount Kilimanjaro and the Pyramids. He photographed, up close, tree lions in Tanzania and leopards and other lions in Kenya. When he heard the border crossing had been opened in Berlin and Berliners were partying on the wall; he grabbed a flight and joined the party. Gerald walked on the Great Wall in China. One could go on about his adventures. A memorial party will be held on January 8, 2011 from 3pm to 6pm, at the Air and Space Center in Hampton, Virginia.", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KEATING, GERALD MAURICE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 925, "_id": "4fd2858f8eb7c8105d856045", "snippet": "KEATING--Gerald Maurice, 74, of Yorktown, VA, died Saturday, November 27, 2010.

The outer atmosphere shrinking was important to Gerald because that's where satellites fly. The decrease in density in the outer atmosphere affects satellite orbits. Gerald went directly to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Hampton, VA after schooling as a Physicist. Bitten by the \"space bug\" in the form of Sputnik 1, there was no other place he wanted to work. At NASA Langley, he received the top NASA award for scientific studies, the Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement; the NASA Langley Award for the \"most outstanding paper\" of 1974, the H.J. E. Reid Award; plus a number of other awards for various discoveries. As a teenager, Gerald invented an adaptation to the popcorn machine at Woolworth's that eliminated the \"widows\" (un-popped kernels) from the bags of popcorn sold at that chain. At the beginning of his career, he figured out the orbital mechanics for the first US communications satellite. He said he \"got extra points for doing a 'dogleg' over Moscow to hear what the Russians were saying.\" Gerald retired from NASA Langley in 1995. Until his death, he was a Senior Staff Research Scientist at The George Washington University. After retiring from NASA, Gerald took about four months to decide he really could not play golf and he was bored. He chose The George Washington University to continue his search for discoveries. While at GWU, Gerald was Principal Investigator/Team Leader for the accelerometer experiments on MGS, MO and MRO. Gerald was the first author of the Mars Thermosphere Planetary Quarantine Model for the Viking Extended Mission. He developed the thermospheric model for the Venus International Reference Atmosphere. This VIRA model was used for Magellan aerobraking and for Pioneer Venus Operations. He was responsible for generating The International Reference Atmosphere of the Earth's Ozone for COSPAR. COSPAR is the International Committee for Space Research established by the International Council of Scientific Unions. He was Chairman of COSPAR'S Sub-commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Aeronomy and Chairman of COSPAR's Task Group on Reference Atmospheres of Trace Species. He headed the Mars International Reference Atmosphere. His bibliography includes more than 150 publications. Gerald was an adventurer, photographer and dare-devil. For many winters, he went skiing down the black diamond slopes of the Matterhorn, in Switzerland. He liked to tell people he \"had been to over 100 countries and two other planets.\" For a month, in the 1960's, he explored and traveled down, by canoe type boat, the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, near where it connects to the Amazon River. Around that time frame, he once, in Peru, bribed (with liquor) a crop duster to fly him over Machu Picchu - an illegal act at the time - so he could look and take pictures. He also, in a similar fashion, got a flight to look at the glyphs in Chile. He took an eye-level (in a bit larger airplane) photo of Mount Everest. One stunt, even he admitted was foolhardy, was taking a picture of a tiger in a zoo in India while being on the same side of the fence as the tiger. In India, Gerald photographed the Taj Mahal, went to Tiger Tops and Lake Dahl. He went on safari in Africa. He got to Mount Kilimanjaro and the Pyramids. He photographed, up close, tree lions in Tanzania and leopards and other lions in Kenya. When he heard the border crossing had been opened in Berlin and Berliners were partying on the wall; he grabbed a flight and joined the party. Gerald walked on the Great Wall in China. One could go on about his adventures. A memorial party will be held on January 8, 2011 from 3pm to 6pm, at the Air and Space Center in Hampton, Virginia.<br><br>\n ", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KEATING, GERALD M."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "925", "_id": "5213e5ed38f0d8740ac8db6d", "snippet": "<!-- GERALD M.

So her next role is a bit of a departure, and not only because she isn't called upon to swing her fists. In the boxing video game Fight Night Champion, which EA Sports will release for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation3 consoles on Tuesday, Ms. Dushku plays the daughter of an unscrupulous fight promoter, and finds herself drawn into an intrigue involving her father and an up-and-coming boxer (played by the actor and athlete LaMonica Garrett). The story, which is told in movie-style sequences that unfold between the game's playable boxing matches, is written by Will Rokos, an Academy Award-nominated writer and producer of ''Monster's Ball,'' and represents the latest effort to bridge the worlds of gaming and cinema. These sequences (which were created using 3-D motion-capture technology) also allowed Ms. Dushku to play a character who was very much herself and yet as unearthly as anything seen on a Joss Whedon show. Ms. Dushku spoke recently to ArtsBeat about the making of Fight Night Champion and her role in the game, and the burdens of being an able-bodied woman in the entertainment industry. These are excerpts from that conversation.Q.I thought it was very brave of you to allow yourself to be photographed during your motion-capture session with your face covered with all those - uh, what do you call them?A.Dots. It's a very technical name. Motion-cap dots. My makeup artist from ''Dollhouse,'' her name's Tegan, she worked on ''Avatar'' and she worked on the game as well, so that was really fun. Nobody places sexy dots like Tegan. If one dot tries to slip off, she is quick on the draw. She will reattach it. Q.And you wouldn't want a dot to go astray.A.No, that would mean, like, a droopy eyelid. It could send your whole expression off and turn you into another person. It would be a travesty.Q.You grew up just outside of Boston. Were you legally required to appreciate boxing?A.Yeah, pretty much. My dad was from the South End and grew up loving sports and boxing himself. I remember having a Mike Tyson T-shirt back in the day that I used to sleep in. And there some things that Tyson did along the way that I wasn't too psyched to associate myself with. But back in the day, just as a fighter, what a dream that was to watch and root for him.Q.Tell me about your Fight Night character, Megan McQueen. She seems to associate with a lot of unsavory figures.A.It's a gnarly, cutthroat world. She's the only daughter of D. L. McQueen, the shady promoter, and her whole life she's had a loyalty to him, but everything changes when she really gets to see his behavior and what he does to Andre. She's always wanted to be a fighter, but she gets into the managing world when she meets Andre. She sees in him the resilience and the passion, and the redemption that he's seeking, and it's something that appeals to her. And for the first time, she goes against her dad and stands for good.Q.Is there a cheat code that makes her a playable character?A.Oh my gosh, I should totally lie and say there is. Yeah, there's a secret password, so everyone buy the game and try to crack the code because there'll be a payoff on the other side. Ooh, child.Q.How was the experience of working on Fight Night Champion different from other games you've been involved in?A.I hadn't done anything like it. I've done other video-game voices: I started with the Buffy video game, and then I did Saints Row, Yakuza and Wet. I grew up with three older brothers and today my two nephews and my boyfriend's son are video-game-freak teenagers, so it's cool to be able to have them play me.

When it comes to book-selling, however, he's something of an old fogey. While his ''Known and Unknown'' may be No. 1 on the hardcover nonfiction list, it's a modest No. 10 on the mother of all mash-up lists shown in the graphic on Page 24 -- which combines fiction and nonfiction, print and e-books -- in part because of comparatively weak e-book sales. The grand strategist James Patterson wins that all-over sales battle, with 56 percent of reported sales coming from e-books -- typical for leading fiction titles. By contrast, a mere 23 percent of Rumsfeld's sales came from e-books, putting him behind nonfiction rivals Laura Hillenbrand (59 percent) and Todd Burpo (43 percent). Rumsfeld also gets a thumping from Lisa Gardner, whose thriller ''Alone'' is the No. 2 overall best-selling title in the United States, with virtually all sales coming from e-books. ''Alone'' had a three-week run on the hardcover list back in 2005, when its full retail price was $24.

I tried to read it, but must have been doing something wrong, because it struck me as old-fashioned and dull, and I could get through only a tiny chunk of it. That chunk, however, contained a statement that changed my reading life forever. The author argued that you didn't truly own a book (spiritually, intellectually) until you had marked it up. This hit home for me -- it spoke to the little scribal monk who lives deep in the scriptorium of my soul -- and I quickly adopted the habit of marginalia: underlining memorable lines, writing keywords in blank spaces, jotting important page numbers inside of back covers. It was addictive, and useful; I liked being able to glance back through, say, ''Great Expectations,'' and discovering all of its great sentences already cued up for me. (Chapter 4, underlined: ''I remember Mr. Hubble as a tough high-shouldered stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.'')

While undergoing training that encouraged torture and even killing to suppress insurgency, he began working as an engineer, mapping and clearing landmines. But after witnessing atrocities against civilians and losing an arm, a leg and several fingers to a mortar blast, Mr. Cho left the army. He built a secret library of banned books and organized demonstrations against the regime. This film from Nic Dunlop, Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern uses testimony, archival film footage and smuggled photographs to trace the country's history and expose abuses inflicted by the one-party system established in 1962 by Gen. Ne Win. After serving 15 years in prison for his pro-democracy political beliefs, Mr. Cho joined his brother and sister in Fort Wayne, Ind., home to one of the largest Burmese communities in the United States.

(HBO Signature) TRANSAMERICA (2005) Felicity Huffman plays Bree, a preoperative transsexual who, though still technically a man, passes for a woman through the use of tasteful pink outfits, meticulously applied makeup and a breathy voice. But before her gender-reassignment surgery she needs to tie up a loose end, and soon Bree is on the road with the previously unknown son (Kevin Zegers) she long ago fathered when she was known as Stanley. ''In this debut feature by Duncan Tucker, who wrote and directed it, 'Transamerica' sets out to affirm Bree's dignity, to liberate her and others like her from any association with camp or freakishness,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''That the film succeeds without slipping too far into sentimentality or didacticism is in no small measure the result of Ms. Huffman's wit and grace.

But the biggest news is what's at No. 3: the cast recording of the Broadway show ''The Book of Mormon.'' According to Billboard it is the highest-charting Broadway album since 1969, when ''Hair'' was No. 1 for 13 weeks. ''The Book of Mormon'' sold 61,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was surely helped by hype for the Tony Awards on Sunday, where it won nine prizes. (Sales for ''The Book of Mormon'' album were so low the week before that it did not make the Billboard 200, the magazine's standard album chart.) But there's a slight catch to the success. Like Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way'' two weeks ago, ''The Book of Mormon'' benefited from a huge markdown by Amazon, which sold the digital version of the album for $1.99 for the four days leading up to the Tonys. As a result, 85 percent of the sales were digital downloads, a much higher ratio than usual. Also on this week's album chart, Adele's ''21'' sold 114,000 copies, bringing it to No. 1, and Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way'' fell to No. 2 with 100,000 sales. The rapper Tech N9ne opened at No. 4 with 56,000 sales of his album ''All 6's & 7's'' (Strange Music), and Ronnie Dunn, of the country duo Brooks & Dunn, bowed at No. 5 with 45,000 sales of his self-titled debut album, released by Arista Nashville. -Album sales so far this year have been holding steady. The tally as of Sunday was 136.9 million, up about half a percent from last year's sales to the same point (136.2 million). That may be a minuscule increase, but it is the third week in a row that weekly album sales have improved year over year, and for an industry accustomed to negative numbers, it's good news.", "headline": {"main": "From the Tonys To the Billboard Chart", "kicker": "ARTS, BRIEFLY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 338, "_id": "4fd2a3748eb7c8105d88898d", "snippet": "Adele returned to the top of the Billboard album chart this week, supplanting Lady Gaga after two weeks.

R. Martin's ''Song of Ice and Fire'' fantasy series, didn't enter the hardcover fiction list at No. 1. That's probably still a safe bet, though I did wonder if I should start firing up the barbecue after it was reported that Amazon Germany had accidentally shipped some 180 copies of ''Dragons'' ahead of the strict July 12 publication date, thus imperilling Martin's carefully orchestrated siege of the global book market. (This week's list reflects sales through July 9, though let it be noted that ''Dragons'' went into its sixth printing based on pre-orders alone. Charge!) Over the years, Martin's desultory writing pace has alienated some die-hard fans, a few of whom have gone as far as to start Web sites devoted to heckling him over the six-year gap between ''A Dance With Dragons'' and the series's previous installment, ''A Feast for Crows.'' But now it's Martin's turn to be angry. In late June, after the Amazon breach prompted perfidious readers to post plot spoilers on the Web, Martin let loose on his blog, writing: ''I am not happy about this. My publishers are furious.

(Family) OVERBOARD (1987) In this comedy directed by Garry Marshall, the rich and spoiled Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn, right), is given a chance to experience life from a completely different (read: poor) perspective. A fall from her yacht gives Joanna amnesia; a vengeful handyman (Kurt Russell), whom she had refused to pay for work he'd done on her boat, claims her as his wife from the hospital where she is recovering. The handyman, Dean Proffitt, is initially interested only in getting what he is owed by putting her to work cleaning his house and, since he's a widower, taking care of his four boys. Dean calls her Annie, gives her some ill-fitting clothes and convinces her that the children are hers. Unsurprisingly, a love story unfolds, and the characters are given an opportunity to understand what truly makes them happy.

Inside, however, she comes on more like Andy Rooney shouting at the nation's ''lactating daddies,'' FarmVille gamers and Ugg-booted children to get off her lawn. Ingraham is also plenty exercised about ''creative'' names, especially when bestowed on celebrity children, like Bronx (Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz), Apple (Gwyneth Paltrow), Blanket (Michael Jackson), Jermajesty (Jermaine Jackson), and Pilot Inspektor (Jason Lee). ''Children should not be named after a piece of furniture, a planet, a fruit or an herb,'' Ingraham, who wrote the book with Raymond Arroyo, declares. ''Today's little ones are saddled with some of the most ridiculous names ever -- it's as if the parents are trying to force the kids to hate them early.'' (Apparently the problem stretches beyond obviously weird monikers: Ingraham cites a 2009 study in Social Science Quarterly suggesting that a child's name can predispose him to a life of crime, with the most ''dangerous'' names being Alec, Ernest, Garland, Ivan, Kareem, Luke, Malcolm, Preston, Tyrell and Walter.) On the positive side, Ingraham does come out strongly against the noxious high-end cupcake craze, and throws in a section on bad pickup lines that suggests that things inside the Beltway are even worse than you think.

NATIONAL An article on Tuesday about Michele Bachmann's plans to reconnect with voters in Iowa misstated the given name of Mrs. Bachmann's personal assistant in some editions. She is Tera Dahl, not Tara. BUSINESS DAY The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about regulations being proposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, misstated the share of the risk that lenders must retain under the law when some mortgages are sold to investors. It is 5 percent, not 10 percent. And an accompanying picture caption misspelled the surname of the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in some editions. She is Mary Schapiro, not Shapiro. An article on Tuesday about an investor's criticism of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters misidentified the Vermont town where Ben & Jerry's ice cream started. It is Burlington -- not Waterbury, where Green Mountain is based. SPORTS The Sports of The Times column on Saturday, about the success of smaller market teams in this year's baseball playoffs, erroneously attributed a distinction to the 1997 Florida Marlins. It was the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks -- not the Marlins -- who were the youngest expansion team to win the World Series. (The Diamondbacks won in their fourth year of existence; the Marlins in their fifth.) An article in some editions on Monday about the possible storylines for the World Series misstated the batting average for St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols against the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series. He batted .478, not .500. THE ARTS An article on Thursday about a collaboration between the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and W magazine referred imprecisely to his legal situation in China. While he was released from detention by the Chinese authorities after signing what they said was a confession to tax evasion, he has not been formally charged with evasion. The article also referred incorrectly to an English-language Twitter account that carries Mr. Ai's comments. It is maintained by supporters who translate his official account; it is not his account. And the article, using information from the Web site of Max Vadukul, who shot the photos of Mr. Ai's project, overstated Mr. Vadukul's role with Rolling Stone magazine. He says he is not in fact a ''leading photographer'' for it. SCIENCE TIMES A caption for a grouping of pictures on Tuesday with an article about the complicated sex lives of dragonflies misidentified the type of dragonfly shown in full view. It is a slaty skimmer, not a blue dasher. INSIDE THE TIMES A headline on a capsule summary on Tuesday for an article about an American law student from Queens who is being held in Egypt overstated his legal status. As the article and the summary itself correctly noted, Egypt has charged the student, who also has Israeli citizenship, with spying for Israel; he is not a ''convicted spy.''

Herman Cain, the long-shot Republican presidential hopeful who took first place in last month's Florida straw poll, certainly seems to think so. Since ''This Is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House'' was released on Oct. 4, the former Godfather's Pizza executive has been spending an awful lot of time in bookstores, signing copies and doing riffs on exclamation-point-happy policy prescriptions like ''Natural resources are there for a reason. Use them!''(Anyone else want to hear those guys from the Miller Lite commercials stage a shout-off between Cain's ''Nine, nine, nine!'' slogan -- a reference to his flat-tax plan -- and the Occupy Wall Street movement's ''We are the 99 percent''?) It took Cain about three months and a few professional collaborators to write the rather slender book, but less than one day after official publication to hit the top 10 on Amazon. According to his publisher, Threshold Editions, the book has already gone back for a sixth printing, with some 100,000 copies in circulation. Recent polls have shown Cain surging in New Hampshire and pulling even with Mitt Romney in Virginia, and the best-seller horse race is equally hard to call: Romney's ''No Apology: The Case for American Greatness'' may have gone straight to No. 1 on the hardcover list in March 2010, but his campaign's new policy treatise, ''Believe in America,'' has been hovering around No. 500 in Amazon's free e-book store. If Cain has been criticized for not spending enough time in New Hampshire (which does have four Barnes & Noble stores, after all), he's already thinking ahead to his first state visit to Uzbekistan (which seems to have none). ''When they ask me who's the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I'm going to say, 'You know, I don't know. Do you know?' '' he told a television interviewer. ''When I get ready to visit that country, I'll know who it is.''", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 621, "_id": "4fd2acbc8eb7c8105d89a284", "snippet": "Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain\u2019s new book \u201cThis Is Herman Cain!

''Unbroken'' tells the story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who was taken prisoner and tortured by the Japanese during World War II. It entered the list at No. 2 last Dec. 5, just below another book about war and torture, George W. Bush's ''Decision Points,'' and just above Jay-Z's ''Decoded.'' Hillenbrand's book has outlasted more than a hip-hop star's and a two-term president's, though. Impressively, it's also vanquished her own previous best seller, ''Seabiscuit,'' which logged 30 weeks on the list back in 2001-2 before making way for the paperback edition. We'll never know whether Man O' War could have beaten his grandson Sea/biscuit, but now we have proof that Prisoner O' War can. ''Unbroken'' received near-unanimous praise when it was published last year, and unsurprisingly, it has also fared well in the court of public opinion. Out of some 1,860 Amazon customers who had weighed in at press time, an astonishing 1,613 gave the book five stars, compared with just 33 one-star ratings. Not bad for an author whose chronic fatigue syndrome is so severe she once went two and a half years without leaving her house. Even Zamperini found her struggles inspiring: ''I sent her one of my Purple Hearts,'' he told The Washington Post last year.

(The exception is Geraldine Brooks's ''March,'' which won in 2006 but never cracked the list.) What about the Man Booker Prize in Britain? It's almost as powerful. Seven of the last 10 winners have gone on to become New York Times best sellers, including this year's pick, ''The Sense of an Ending,'' by Julian Barnes, which has logged five weeks thus far and is still lurking on the hardcover extended list at No. 18. The title of Barnes's novel is lifted from the critic Frank Kermode, which should surprise nobody: throughout 14 works of fiction, Barnes has sampled other writers so much he's like a literary version of Big Daddy Kane. Sometimes his borrowings are clear, as in ''Flaubert's Parrot'' (about a man whose obsession with Flaubert masks his grief for his marriage) or ''Arthur & George'' (a mystery about the real-life Arthur Conan Doyle). Sometimes they're less so. For a long time, my favorite Barnes line came from the protagonist of his first novel, ''Metroland,'' who sums up his youthful aestheticism this way: ''Some people say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading.'' Then I learned he was actually quoting the early-20th-century critic Logan Pearsall Smith. Come to think of it, the decision to have this character hide behind somebody else's obscure (to me), slightly fusty words is so appropriate, and so revealing, that it may still be my favorite Barnes line, even if Barnes didn't write it.", "headline": {"main": "Inside the List", "kicker": "TBR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 618, "_id": "4fd2b9f88eb7c8105d8b03d7", "snippet": "Julian Barnes\u2019s novel \u201cThe Sense of an Ending\u201d continues lurking on the best-seller list, one of several testaments to the influence of literary prizes.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2011/12/18/books/review/18inside-pic/18inside-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2011/12/18/books/review/18inside-pic/18inside-pic-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BARNES, JULIAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gregory", "lastname": "COWLES"}], "original": "By GREGORY COWLES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2011-12-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "MONDAY'S PUZZLE - Today's constructor, Richard Chisholm, has not been seen around these parts for almost a year, but he's actually a fairly prolific puzzle maker.
