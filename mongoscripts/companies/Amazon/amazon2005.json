His latest book, ''Values in Times of Upheaval,'' above, published only a week ago, was sold out.

''Salt of the Earth,'' a transcript of a long interview given by Cardinal Ratzinger nearly a decade ago, was his leading title in Germany, and also in the United States, where it held No.7 on Amazon. Sting Springs a Surprise Students in a music composition class at the University of Illinois at Chicago got a surprise the other day when a former schoolteacher, whose name happens to be Sting, offered the day's lessons, Reuters reported. Told only that their class was to be filmed for a promotional video for the university, the students burst into cheers when Sting and his band entered through a side door on Monday -- with MTV cameras in tow. He began by playing ''Message in a Bottle,'' one of his hits when he led the rock trio the Police to fame in the 1970's and 80's. He also took questions from the students and discussed influences on his music and composition techniques. ''A blank page terrifies me -- that's why I tour so much,'' he said. ''The more I figure out about music, the more I realize I haven't a clue.'' Before finishing by inviting the students to join him and his band by jamming on his hit ''Every Breath You Take,'' he told them to keep playing music to nourish the soul. The class was filmed for ''Stand In,'' to be seen on Monday on mtvU, an MTV college channel available to 6.4 million students on 700 campuses. Jumping to Conclusions The Chicago Symphony Orchestra cautioned yesterday against reading too much into the conductor Riccardo Muti's statement this week that it had made him an offer. The orchestra, whose music director, Daniel Barenboim, is to leave next year, said in a statement that Mr. Muti, who resigned this month after 19 years at La Scala, had been asked to conduct ''after an absence from our podium of 30 years.'' It added, ''Currently, however, there is no news to report regarding the C.S.O.'s music director search.''

Dancers and choreographers have been succumbing to this work since its premiere at the Paris Opera, in 1876, and it's easy to see why. The irresistible score, by L\u00e9o Delibes, abounds with melodic grace and rhythmic verve, and the remarkable heroine, a follower of the goddess Diana, combines the confidence and athleticism of a huntress with the melting vulnerability of a lovelorn nymph. But the temptation is also a trap. Consider these sobering facts. Although productions of ''Copp\u00e9lia,'' Delibes's other great and equally melodic ballet score, have been delighting audiences ever since 1870, ''Sylvia'' keeps getting lost. The original choreography, by Louis M\u00e9rante, was short-lived. Renowned European choreographers like Lev Ivanov, L\u00e9o Staats and Serge Lifar tried to resuscitate ''Sylvia'' in the early 20th century, but failed to make it a staple. Even the most important later production, Frederick Ashton's three-act version for the Royal Ballet (then known as Sadler's Wells) in 1952, faded from the repertory.", "headline": {"main": "The Irresistible Sylvia Seduces Again", "kicker": "DANCE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 926, "_id": "4fd24ac38eb7c8105d7e924d", "snippet": "Divine music and heavenly choreography, but a plot only the gods can unravel.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/arts/dance/29ande.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/05/26/arts/29ande_CA1ready.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/05/26/arts/29ande_CA1ready.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/05/29/arts/29ande_CA0ready.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/05/29/arts/29ande_CA0ready.html", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/05/29/arts/29ande75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/05/29/arts/29ande75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DELIBES, LEO"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN BALLET THEATER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jack", "lastname": "ANDERSON"}], "original": "By JACK ANDERSON"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-05-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "SundayBusiness", "lead_paragraph": "FIVE years ago, Chris Peters was a former programmer who had made a fortune from his Microsoft stock options.

The computer knows to ignore the mortar of sentences -- articles, prepositions, pronouns -- to get to ''the real nitty-gritty,'' Lodge writes, ''words like love or dark or heart or God.'' But the computer's conclusion causes the novelist to shrink from ever writing again. His favorite word, it finds, is ''greasy.'' Two decades later, Amazon.com, improving on its popular ''search inside the book'' function, in April introduced a concordance program, whereby a click of the mouse reveals a book's most frequently occurring words, ''excluding common words.'' Further clicks reveal their contexts. And so we learn that the nitty-gritty words appearing most frequently in the King James Bible include ''God,'' ''Lord,'' ''shall'' and ''unto.''

One of the most wickedly enjoyable gardening books of this season is Nicola Shulman's brief, scintillating portrait of another imperfect genius, Reginald Farrer, in A RAGE FOR ROCK GARDENING (Godine, $20). Despite his privileged upbringing in Yorkshire, Farrer, who died while plant-collecting in Burma in 1920, faced several hardships in life, including nearly dwarflike stature, a cleft palate and lip.

Asness is a very successful hedge-fund manager, and very successful hedge-fund managers make stupendous amounts of money, even by Wall Street's extravagant standards. And in the public mind, their staggering compensation tends to overshadow pretty much everything else. ''Filthy Stinking Rich'' was New York magazine's unambiguous take on the hedge-fund phenomenon some months ago. Last month, in its survey of the best-paid hedge-fund managers, Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine reported that the average pay for the top 25 hedge-fund managers was an astounding $251 million in 2004. Asness himself has written, in one of his better lines, that hedge funds ''are generally run for rich people in Geneva, Switzerland, by rich people in Greenwich, Conn.'' Asness likes to point out that he wrote that sentence before he moved his own hedge fund, AQR Capital Management, to Greenwich, Conn. He started AQR, with three partners, in the spring of 1998, when he was 31 and had just walked away from a high-paying job at Goldman Sachs, where he was one of the firm's brightest young stars. During AQR's first three years, Asness and his partners didn't make much money. But by 2002, the firm was doing well, investors were clamoring to get in and AQR was managing about $3 billion in assets. (It's up to around $13.5 billion today.) And the partners were getting rich. Asness cracked the Alpha list for 2002, taking down a reported $37 million. The next year, the magazine reported, he made $50 million. Asness won't discuss the specifics of his pay, but if you ask him what it's like to have that kind of money, he won't duck the question the way most hedge-fund managers do. Instead, he'll lean back on his couch, scratch his neatly trimmed beard for a minute and then offer a sheepish smile and an endearing, exaggerated shrug. ''To quote Dudley Moore in the movie 'Arthur,' '' he'll reply finally, ''it doesn't suck.''", "headline": {"main": "The Quantitative, Data-Based, Risk-Massaging Road to Riches"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "44", "word_count": 7409, "_id": "4fd25f028eb7c8105d80e1d2", "snippet": "Like other hedge-fund managers, Cliff Asness has made money in a lackluster market.

Except one: No. 5, Eva Cassidy. Cassidy, right, was an angelic-voiced but little-known singer whose death from cancer at 33, in 1996, inspired a phenomenal demand for her renditions of songbook standards, jazz and gospel, leading to six posthumous albums culled from unreleased recordings. She's not necessarily out of place on Amazon's list, which skews wildly toward white pop-rock (the only solo black artist is Ray Charles at No. 23) and hardly reflects album sales beyond Amazon. But ahead of Bob Dylan (No. 9), Bruce Springsteen (No. 12) and Elvis (No. 25)? The explanation probably lies in the rise of the Internet as a tastemaker, and the explosive growth of online commerce that Amazon itself pioneered. The independent Blix Street label began releasing Cassidy's recordings in 1998, the year Amazon added music to its inventory. A word-of-mouth campaign, fueled by chat rooms and fan sites, began to seep into the news media, and by December 2000 two Cassidy albums had pushed a top-selling Beatles compilation down to No. 3 at Amazon, with three other Cassidy albums at Nos. 4, 5 and 7. Just how many CD's she has sold on Amazon to reach No. 5 is unknown; the company does not release sales information other than comparative rankings. But thanks to Amazon consumers, Eva Cassidy is enjoying an unlikely, and lucrative, sort of immortality.

Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays.

The manager said reports from Britain that Ms. Peyroux had vanished were a hoax. ''She was never missing,'' said the manager, Cynthia B. Herbst. ''She's fine and looking forward to going back on the road.'' The BBC reported over the weekend that Ms. Peyroux's distributor in Europe, Universal Classics, said she had not appeared for promotional work for her album ''Careless Love'' and was concerned that she might be missing. The label said it had hired a private detective, the BBC reported. Ms. Herbst said Ms. Peyroux was resting after a grueling tour, from May through mid-August. In a statement, her American label, Rounder Records, said, ''Recent news reports regarding Madeleine Peyroux are the result of a hoax story planted in the U.K.'' New Suspects in 'Scream' Theft The police in Norway say they are seeking eight new suspects in the theft of Edvard Munch's painting ''The Scream,'' left, a year ago, Agence France-Presse reported. The inspector in charge of the investigation, Iver Stensrud, said the police ''foresee new arrests'' in the case. The eight suspects are in addition to five who have already been arrested. Three of those remain in custody, while the others, who are believed to have played a minor role in the theft, have been released. ''The Scream'' and another Munch painting, ''Madonna,'' were stolen a year ago yesterday by two armed robbers who burst into the Munch Museum in Oslo and threatened a member of the staff with a gun. The two paintings, believed to have a combined worth of as much as $100 million, are still missing, and hopes of finding them are fading. A spokeswoman for the museum said, ''The chances of finding the paintings diminish with time, and already a lot of time has passed.'' Barenboim on West Bank The conductor Daniel Barenboim, below, took his West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, whose members come from Israel, the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, to the West Bank last night. It presented a concert in Ramallah dedicated to the memory of the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said, a co-founder of the orchestra, who died in 2003. The Associated Press reported that the concert, which included works by Beethoven and Mozart, drew a standing-room-only audience to Ramallah's 700-seat concert hall, with a spillover crowd watching on closed-circuit television in a nearby hall. ''Believe me,'' Mr. Barenboim said in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, ''the logistics of this concert are worth writing a book about.'' Mr. Barenboim, an Israeli who has frequently spoken out in defense of Palestinian rights, has performed in Ramallah as a pianist but never with this orchestra. The orchestra had hoped to perform there last year, but that concert was canceled for security reasons. Enter a Digital Publisher Amazon.com started life as an online bookstore before branching out into clothes, jewelry, electronics and more. In its latest venture, the Web behemoth returns to its book roots, this time as a publisher. The company has unveiled a program, Amazon Shorts, offering what it calls short-form literature -- including personal memoirs, one-act plays and stories -- by established authors like Danielle Steel, Pico Iyer and Tama Janowitz, Publishers Weekly said. The works cost 49 cents each and can be downloaded at Amazon.com/shorts and elsewhere on the site. Publishers Weekly reports that while some publishers had qualms about the program, many agents endorsed it, saying it could lead to an increase in traditional sales. Challenging an NC-17 The company distributing the Canadian director Atom Egoyan's film ''Where the Truth Lies'' says it plans to appeal the film's NC-17 rating -- if it gets one. Robert Lantos, who is chairman of the company, ThinkFilm, and the producer of the film, was quoted in The Hollywood Reporter as saying that he expected the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board to classify the film NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted) because of a graphic sex scene with Kevin Bacon, Colin Firth and Rachel Blanchard. He said he would appeal the rating, which most studios try to avoid because it restricts a movie's commercial prospects. The motion picture association said no appeal date could be set until the rating was officially published. ThinkFilm also distributes ''The Aristocrats,'' the critically praised documentary about a dirty joke, which it chose to release unrated rather than submit it to the ratings board because it expected an NC-17. Injury at Stones Concert A 20-year-old Connecticut woman was hospitalized with broken bones after she climbed onto the rafters of Fenway Park in Boston and fell 35 to 40 feet during Sunday night's Rolling Stones concert, The Associated Press reported. The police said the woman, whose name was not made public, broke both her ankles and a wrist, and was in stable condition. The concert was the first stop on the Stones' North American tour. In other Rolling Stones news, Sirius Satellite Radio has announced that it will devote an entire channel to the group's music from today through Sept. 29. Footnotes The FX cable network has ordered a third season of ''Rescue Me,'' the critically praised series about New York firefighters starring Denis Leary. The veteran Hawaiian entertainer Don Ho, 75, below, was hospitalized on Friday after experiencing shortness of breath and has postponed a scheduled tour of the mainland, The Associated Press reported. The Australian soprano Miriam Allan, who had been fighting the flu, collapsed onstage during a concert in Sydney on Saturday, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. She was treated by Marie Bashir, the governor of New South Wales and a doctor by training, who was in the audience. The family of the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin has threatened to sue the producers of ''The Last King of Scotland,'' a film based on a fictionalized version of his rule. Agence France-Presse reported that Amin's eldest son, Taban Amin, said that the family might sue for defamation and that it deserved millions in compensation for the depiction of his father in the movie, which stars Forest Whitaker as Amin. The title refers to Amin's stated desire to take over from Queen Elizabeth II as monarch to the Scots.", "headline": {"main": "Arts, Briefly"}, "abstract": "Arts, Briefly column; manager Cynthia Herbst says American jazz singer Madeleine Peyroux is not missing and that report from Britain was hoax (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1050, "_id": "4fd24d668eb7c8105d7ede62", "snippet": "Jazz singer Madeleine Peyroux was never missing, manager says, new suspects in \"Scream\" theft, an injury at Stones concert and more culture news.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/arts/23arts.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HERBST, CYNTHIA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PEYROUX, MADELEINE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MUNCH, EDVARD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BARENBOIM, DANIEL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "EGOYAN, ATOM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOAXES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MISSING PERSONS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Peter", "lastname": "Keepnews"}], "original": "Compiled by Peter Keepnews"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-08-23T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 42}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

It is obvious that the stranger (Terence Stamp) is not the guest they have been expecting, but with his elegant manner, open blue eyes and easy sexuality, the family accepts him anyway. Soon, he has seduced them all, spiritually and physically, beginning with the peasant maid, who recognizes something more than human in him. By applying his perfect, unconditional and unreservedly sexual love to all of them, he liberates something revolutionary in their souls. Then he vanishes, leaving the characters transformed into saints, unable to return to the lives they knew and, in the case of the industrialist (Massimo Girotti), doomed to wander the wilderness forever, howling in pain. ''Teorema'' means ''theorem'' in Italian, and the title suggests that Pier Paolo Pasolini, who made this original and frequently imitated film in 1968, was more than aware of the schematic, mathematical basis of his screenplay.

On Sept. 30, having received a release from her source, she testified before the grand jury that the source was the vice president's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby.

George Grizzard, Frances Sternhagen, Elizabeth Marvel and Frederick Weller star in the revival of Edward Albee's interspecies drama about a couple who meet two talking lizards on the beach (2:00). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Nov. 16. Developed at the Actors Studio, this new production of Samuel Beckett's landmark play stars Sam Coppola and Joseph Ragno as Vladimir and Estragon (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton,(212) 239-6200. 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Opens Nov. 17. After a West End run, this Victorian thriller by Andrew Lloyd Webber comes to Broadway with the British musical theater star Michael Ball. Trevor Nunn (''Cats'') directs (3:00). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. Broadway 'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley). 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'IN MY LIFE' Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley). 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette) 'CATHAY: THREE TALES OF CHINA' Joins puppetry, film and animation. The director-writer Ping Chong and the Shaanxi Folk Theater of China have created enchanting and moving theater (1:40). New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Margo Jefferson) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FIVE COURSE LOVE' This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman) 'KARLA' The decks are stacked in Steve Earle's play about the death row inmate Karla Faye Tucker. It is strong on heartfelt narrative, but equally strong on preachy sentiment and wishfulness (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'MARION BRIDGE' The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Jefferson) 'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Sarah Schulman's intermittently zingy play is an awkward mixture of cultural satire and earnest psychodrama about love and responsibility. Deirdre O'Connell gives a warm, engaging performance as a reformed rebel with a colorful past that bleeds into the present in sensational ways (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'MEDEA' The Jean Cocteau Repertory's clich\u00e9-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, near East Second Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jefferson) 'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SLUT' This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley). 'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS, OR: WHAT AM I DOING HERE?' A revue of satiric songs and sketches by Roger Rosenblatt that seeks to comment on the state of the national psyche. It's not good, apparently, but what's new? A bright cast keeps things lively, but Mr. Rosenblatt's targets are mostly moldy (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101 (Isherwood) 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'NORMAL' A misguided musical about a youngster's battle with anorexia and the stress it puts on her family. Gag (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'THE SALVAGE SHOP' Jim Nolan's moving, old fashioned drama, about a fraught father-and-son relationship in a small coastland town in Ireland, delivers an emotional punch (2:30). The Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'EINSTEIN'S GIFT' Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'INDIA AWAITING' The charismatic Maulik Pancholy is an Indian-born Wall Street trader torn between his love for an American woman and his lingering ties to home (2:00). Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Horn) 'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231, closing Sunday. (Jefferson) 'WAR IN PARAMUS' It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today; only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger). Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system. (Stephen Holden) * 'BALLETS RUSSES' (No rating, 118 minutes) This documentary, combining the reminiscences of retired dancers with archival clips of their work, tells the story of two rival companies that shaped ballet in the mid-20th century. It is lively and moving enough to appeal even to nonballetomanes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott) * 'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis) 'DOOM' (R, 95 minutes) In this formulaic, claustrophobic shoot-'em-up, based on a video game, soldiers quell a mutant uprising on Mars. Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as the Rock, is the trigger-happy troop leader, while Rosamund Pike is the forensic archaeologist, who, like the audience, is trapped in a loud, hellish enclosure. (Ned Martel) 'DREAMER: INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY' (PG, 105 minutes) Pure, schmaltzy formula -- an injured racehorse, a down-on-his-luck trainer, his angelically cute daughter -- but just try to resist it.(Scott) 'ELIZABETHTOWN' (PG-13, 121 minutes) A well-intentioned mess from Cameron Crowe, in which a young man (the weightless Orlando Bloom) loses his job and his father and finds true love (the hard-working Kirsten Dunst) -- all in the course of a very short week and a very long two hours. (Scott) 'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates) 'G' (R, 97 minutes) The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is the backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.'' Soapy but well acted. (Laura Kern) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott) * 'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis) * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis) * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis) 'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Holden) 'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of L.A. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott) 'THE LEGEND OF ZORRO' (PG, 126 minutes) Like most sequels, this successor to ''The Mask of Zorro'' feels obliged to outperform its forerunner by being bigger, faster and more spectacular. That translates into busier, sloppier, less coherent and more frantic. (Holden) 'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates) 'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden) 'NEW YORK DOLL' (PG-13, 75 minutes) Greg Whiteley's small, tender documentary portrait looks at life after rock and roll as experienced by Arthur ''Killer'' Kane, the original bassist for the legendary glam-punk band the New York Dolls, who, at 55, enjoys a reunion that becomes a sweet last hurrah. (Holden) * 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden) 'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) 'PRIME' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Actually, pretty mediocre. A thin romantic comedy that nonetheless has its charms, most of them provided by Uma Thurman as a divorced 37-year-old who falls for a 23-year old who happens to be her therapist's son. (Scott) * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden) 'THE PROTOCOLS OF ZION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Marc Levin's ''Protocols of Zion,'' a documentary about a century-old forgery purporting to reveal a Jewish master plan to rule the world, makes its case expertly and powerfully. The film even has laughs (which is no small feat), but the cumulative effect of its message is enormous sadness that hate is so strong and so resistant to reason.(Gates) 'SAW II' (R, 91 minutes) Jigsaw, the sicko known for masterminding twisted life-or-death games, returns for a sequel that doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor, though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself. (Kern) * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott) * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott) 'STAY' (R, 98 minutes) The director Marc Forster, whose previous films include ''Finding Neverland,'' takes a maximalist approach to this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and lots of crazily raked angles. (Dargis) 'THREE EXTREMES' (R, 125 minutes, in Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese) This trilogy provides a sampler of short horror films from high-profile Asian directors: China's Fruit Chan, South Korea's Park Chan-Wook, and Japan's Takashi Miike. ''Three Extremes'' may seem tame to jaded fans of what's been termed ''New Asian Horror,'' but it serves as a fine introduction to the genre for those who are curious but squeamish. (Dana Stevens) 'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis) 'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden) 'EL VACIL\u00d3N: THE MOVIE' (R, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Luis Jimenez and Moonshadow, hosts of the wildly popular morning show on La Mega radio (WSKQ-FM), play themselves making a movie about their lives and their listeners' sexual adventures. The result is 90 minutes of over-the-top gross-out humor. (Gates) * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott) 'THE WEATHER MAN' (R, 102 minutes) No one relishes having his cake and eating it, too, more than Hollywood filmmakers. The latest case in point is a fainthearted bid at social satire called ''The Weather Man,'' about a middle-aged man (played by a hard-working Nicolas Cage) gazing into the yawning void of his life. (Dargis) Film Series CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Nov. 22) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children continues with two dramas.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AEROSMITH, LENNY KRAVITZ (Tuesday and Thursday) The classic rock band Aerosmith has extended its career by being open to new styles. In the 1980's, the band collaborated with rap's Run DMC and, in the 90's, with the schmaltzy but effective ballad-smith Dianne Warren. Lenny Kravits does the opposite, pursuing the aesthetic and lifestyle of a late-60's guitar hero. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $38 to $128.

(Laura Sinagra) TREY ANASTASIO (Tuesday) This leader of the now defunct jam band Phish has spent recent down time joining prot\u00e9g\u00e9es onstage and recording a stripped-down guitar album, ditching the studio filigree of his previous solo outing. 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $38. (Sinagra) ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) This London art-rock quartet satirizes the safe rock milieu with its petulant stomp ''Formed a Band.'' With a talk-sing delivery more empathetic than that of Johnny Rotten but testier than that of Fred Schneider of the B-52's, Eddie Argos captures both the excitement and absurdity of pop. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12.

Thursday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16.50. (Sinagra) BROADCAST (Thursday) This pop group buries its melodies in static and hum, with the chilly voice of Trish Keenan providing the compelling thread through a jumble of half-recalled movie themes and sometimes ominous disarray. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) BROOKS & DUNN (Thursday) This long-running country duo tries to get its hillbilly on with a new batch of songs, including the vaguely rap-phobic ''Play Something Country.'' 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $37.50 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra) CALLA (Tomorrow) Burrowing into the dark corners of New Wave's shiny, happy side, the band Calla finds something more than brooding and vintage black couture. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13. (Sinagra) CONSTANTINES, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Sunday) The Constantines' Bry Webb's baritone may rumble like that of other popular post-punk revivalists, but his acute sense of drone and sting sets the band's darkly pulsing indie rock apart. The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls the Embarassment. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sinagra) VLADISLAV DELAY (A K A LUOMO) (Tomorrow and Monday) This Finnish producer records and performs under various pseudonyms with different stylistic identities. Tomorrow, when he plays as the groovy Luomo, expect extended, meticulously building micro-house beats. As Delay on Monday, you imagine that he will become glitchier and more ominously atmospheric. Tomorrow at 10 p.m. and Monday at 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $14 tomorrow, $10 Monday. (Sinagra) DIOS MALOS (Tonight) This laid-back quintet from Hawthorne, Calif., plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a sofa daydream rather than a desert drive. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) BEN FOLDS (Monday) Moving still further from the smarm of earlier incarnations, the gen-x piano man Ben Folds, who combines Billy Joel melodics with an ironic remove, lately reflects more somberly on fatherhood, blue-state regrets and the loss of idols like Elliot Smith. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $30 to $45. (Sinagra) AL GREEN (Tonight) Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together'' sound like aching, immediate pleas; sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does. 6, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $175 first come, first seated; $100 standing room only. (Jon Pareles) THE HOLD STEADY, BLOOD ON THE WALL (Monday) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. Blood on the Wall, the Brooklyn trio fronted by the guitarist and vocalist Brad Shanks and his sister, the bassist and vocalist Courtney Shanks, make hip-shaking rock with a touch of Midwestern-gothic twang. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $17. (Sinagra) JEM (Monday) The British sprite Jem writes and sings upbeat trip-pop that is informed by cheeky hip-hop. Her music is less schmaltzy or dire than similar fare by Dido or Beth Orton. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra) LA GUITARA: KAKI KING, PATTY LARKIN, MIMI FOX AND MURIEL ANDERSON (Sunday) The songwriter and guitarist Patty Larkin organized this showcase tour of female guitarists, including herself, the sassy Kaki King, the jazzy Mimi Fox and the fingerstyle player Muriel Anderson. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $30. (Sinagra) CYNDI LAUPER (Tuesday) The New Waver Cyndi Lauper has become a visible social activist, while retaining the zany streak that made her jumpy pro-girl pop songs and emotional synthesizer ballads favorites on MTV in the 80's. 8 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $40. (Sinagra) LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES, ANTIBALAS (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. The music insists on keeping the dance floor busy. Antibalas gets its funk by way of Nigeria, where Fela Kuti concocted Afrobeat to meld politics and propulsion; it's a large band that has made Fela's burly grooves its own. 11 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $22.

(Sinagra) RICKY MARTIN, JON SECADA, FRANKIE J (Tuesday) For the last few years, Ricky Martin has courted the Latin American audience with Spanish-language pop. This year his Latin confections are in English again, though his attempts to scuff them up with reggaeton beats and guest rappers are transparent. The Latin pop balladeer Jon Secada and the Tijuana-born R & B singer Frankie J also play. 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $77 to $97. (Sinagra) DEL MCCOURY BAND WITH ABIGAIL WASHBURN (Thursday) The bluegrass banjo master Del McCoury upholds high lonesome traditions while still entertaining new directions, most notably his band's work backing the edgier Steve Earle in 1999.

(Sinagra) SIMPLE PLAN (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band has done right by its name. The simple plan is to toggle between yell and swoon, to slam power chords and emote with the indignant air-punch of a guy who just got dumped at the prom. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $25. (Both shows sold out.) (Sinagra) SPOON, AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB, MARY TIMONY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Austin indie standout Brit Daniels's latest album is a tougher nut to crack than 2002's nearly flawless jitter-rock ''Kill the Moonlight'' (Merge). Live, his tight group, Spoon, swings from slacker angst to caffeinated bravado. The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints. The whimsical indie-rocker Mary Timony also plays. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $23.50.

(Chinen) CHARLIE PEACOCK (Wednesday) Mr. Peacock, a producer and keyboardist well established in contemporary Christian music, has a guest-laden new album, ''Love Press Ex-Curio'' (Emergent/92e), that convincingly embraces a worldly sort of fusion; he performs here with the saxophonist Jeff Coffin, the trumpeter Maurice Brown, the bassist Felix Pastorius and the drummer Matt Wilson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) * DJANGO REINHARDT FESTIVAL (Tuesday through Nov. 13) What began as a salute to this immortal French Gypsy guitarist has evolved into a smorgasbord of buoyant swing, and a New York institution. This season's stars include the guitarists Dorado Schmitt and Angelo Debarre and the accordionist Ludovic Beier; the clarinetist Ken Peplowski (Tuesday); the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen (Wednesday); and the tenor saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin (Thursday). 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30 and $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) DAVID SANBORN (Tuesday through Nov. 13) Mr. Sanborn, an alto saxophonist known for tart crossover fare, plays material from ''Closer'' (Verve), a smooth but sturdy recent album; notwithstanding the sterling percussionist Don Alias, his rhythm section comprises members of the Geoffrey Keezer Trio. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $47.50 at tables with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) E. J. STRICKLAND PROJECT (Tonight) Mr. Strickland, a proficient young drummer, assembles an intriguing combination of tonalities: the saxophones of John Ellis, the piano of George Colligan, the percussion of Khalil Kwame Bell and the vocals of Gretchen Parlato and Charenee Wade. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15; $10 for members. (Chinen) CLARK TERRY QUINTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Terry's buoyant trumpet style and comic vocalizing have long made him one of jazz's most beloved personalities; his five-piece band has a soulful guest in the singer Mary Stallings. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) TONE COLLECTOR (Tuesday) The tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jeff Davis make up this experimental acoustic threesome, which recently released a bristling debut on Norway's Jazzaway label; they're joined here by a fellow traveler, Ben Gerstein, on trombone. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Koze Lounge, 676 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-8282; cover, $7. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The Metropolitan Opera's big, colorful ''Aida'' gets a new Radames (Franco Farina) and Amneris (Yvonne Naef) to join its recently new Aida (Hasmik Papian). 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Bernard Holland) 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn) 'COS\u00cc FAN TUTTE' (Tonight) This is the ultimate ensemble opera and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production is an impressive ensemble effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. The soprano Barbara Frittoli and the mezzo-soprano Maria Zifchak play the sisters, whose devotion to their fianc\u00e9s proves so ephemeral. James Levine conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Monday and Thursday) The admirable American soprano Elizabeth Futral gives a vibrant, incisive and vocally top-notch performance in the touchstone title role of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor.'' Still, on opening night she was so concerned with singing this daunting role honestly that she seemed reluctant to plumb the emotional recesses of this unstable and fascinating character. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini) * 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' (Tomorrow) Contemporary opera has always been New York City Opera's soul, if not necessarily its bread and butter. Its latest adventure is this gripping horror tale with an emotionally searing 12-tone score by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett and a taut libretto by Beverley Cross, all set in a suitably dark staging. The superb cast includes Jessie Raven, Mark Duffin, Caroline Worra and Timothy Nolen in the major roles. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Kozinn) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The venerable Amato Opera may seat scarcely more than 100, but it can't be accused of cowardice. Its current run is one of the hardest operas for soprano in the repertory, Verdi's ''Traviata.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; students and 65+, $25. (Anne Midgette) 'TURANDOT' (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) If your idea of a stimulating evening is watching a beefy and clearly none too intelligent prince devoting himself to winning the heart of a creepy harridan -- and, O.K., singing ''Nessun Dorma'' along the way -- the company's venerable Beni Montresor staging (now directed by Beth Greenberg) is back on the boards, with a strong cast that includes Lori Phillips in the title role, Philip Webb as Calaf and Guylaine Girard as Li\u00f9. Tonight at 8; Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Kozinn) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday and Thursday) Intimate and picturesque, this converted coffee barge is one of the best places to hear chamber music in New York. Beethoven piano trios figure prominently into its programs this weekend, with Schubert's Trio in E flat also on offer tonight and tomorrow, and Rachmaninoff's haunting ''Trio \u00c9l\u00e9giaque'' and Alexander Vynnytsky's ''Tangos'' sharing the program with Beethoven on Sunday. On Thursday, the focus shifts to the piano, with Tereza Lee. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students. (Kozinn) CAMERATA IRELAND (Wednesday) Here's an unusual expression of musical nationalism: the musicians in this ensemble are all Irish, but some of them live and usually work outside Ireland. The program itself is international, with works by Penderecki and Beethoven (including the Fourth Piano Concerto, with Barry Douglas as the soloist), as well as a contemporary Irish work, John Kinsella's Nocturne for Strings. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Kozinn) 'A CENTURY OF NORWEGIAN INDEPENDENCE' (Sunday) Norway celebrates itself with a program of little-known music, from a violin concerto by the country's composer Arne Nordheim, to the American premiere of a piece Johan Halvorsen wrote in 1910 to honor Theodore Roosevelt, incorporating the American national anthem and ''Yankee Doodle.'' Per Brevig conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. 7 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $65. (Midgette) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) The Chamber Music Society's youth movement is in action with the Borromeo String Quartet and the pianist Jonathan Biss playing the Stravinsky Concertino, Schoenberg's First String Quartet and the beloved Schumann Piano Quintet. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Holland) CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) In his final season as music director in Chicago, Daniel Barenboim offers a little of everything, from a piece Elliott Carter wrote for him and the orchestra, ''Soundings,'' to Mahler's Fifth. If you miss the concert in New York, the symphony is offering a reprise in New Jersey (Schoenberg and Schubert). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $120. Sunday afternoon at 2, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $27 to $92. (Midgette) DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES AND MAKI NAMEKAWA (Wednesday) Mr. Davies is most often heard as a conductor, but here he partners with another pianist for an enticing evening of chamber music. The program lists works by Philip Glass and Shoko Shida, but the highlight may be Messiaen's sprawling mystical treatise for two pianos, ''Visions de l'Amen.'' 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Jeremy Eichler) GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri trudges on into another season as the de facto quartet-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Each of its six concerts will feature a Mozart quartet, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Oboe Quartet (with Joseph Robinson) as well as Debussy's Quartet and Brahms's Quartet No. 3. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler) LEILA JOSEFOWICZ (Thursday) With John Novacek at the piano, this violinist offers a program lying largely in the 20th century: Messiaen, Salonen, Mark Grey and Ravel. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 and $35. (Holland) McDUFFIE-DUTTON-KIRSHBAUM TRIO (Tomorrow) Three star string players play three major string trios. Lawrence Dutton, who is also the violist of the Emerson String Quartet; Robert McDuffie, a violinist, and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, currently touring together, come to New York, with Dohnanyi's Serenade in C and trios by Beethoven and Mozart. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $30. (Midgette) MUSIC BEFORE 1800 (Sunday) Galatea, a European early-music ensemble founded by the lute player Paul Beier, makes its New York debut with works by Marini, Buonamente, Rognoni and Terzi. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+ . (Eichler) MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) The touring arm of this venerable festival arrives in New York with a program of Beethoven (String Trio, Op. 9, No. 2), Berg (''Lyric Suite'') and Dvorak (String Sextet). One hopes that they also bring along the festival's relaxed and spontaneous spirit of music-making. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Eichler) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) The Finnish conductor Mikko Franck pays a visit to the New York Philharmonic, bringing with him music by Schnittke, Shostakovich and Beethoven, not to mention the violinist Gidon Kremer. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76 this afternoon, $26 to $94 tomorrow. (Holland) GIACINTO SCELSI: 100th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight) The Italian modernist composer Giacinto Scelsi, who died in 1988, would surely be amazed to see the attention that has come to his work in recent years. A mysterious figure who suffered a debilitating mental breakdown in midcareer, he was essentially unknown outside contemporary music circles in Italy during his lifetime. Celebrating his centenary, the adventurous Flux Quartet will play all five of Scelsi's string quartets. 8, Miller Theater, Broadway and 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini) DEBORAH VOIGT AND BEN HEPPNER (Wednesday) Wagner fans in New York have long had this date circled on their calendars, when the soprano Deborah Voigt and the tenor Ben Heppner, two of the leading Wagnerian voices of our day, will present a joint concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, Asher Fisch conducting. There will be arias from Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Weber's ''Freisch\u00fctz,'' but Wagner dominates, and there is much to savor. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Through Sunday) The company's lamentably short three-week City Center season ends Sunday afternoon.

(Jennifer Dunning) BALAM DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) The company celebrates its 25th-anniversary season with a program of dances that blend traditional Balinese theater and contemporary dance.

The books, with one scene from each portrayed as a duet, are ''Anna Karenina,'' ''The Fountainhead,'' ''East of Eden'' and ''Franny and Zooey.''

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., First Unitarian Church of Brooklyn, 121 Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org; $15; students and 62+, $12.

(Rockwell) JANE GOLDBERG: 'BELLY TAP FOR WORLD PEACE' (Tonight through Sunday nights) Variously known as ''the tap goddess of the Lower East Side'' and the originator of the ''tap and schmooze'' format, Ms. Goldberg is also a performer who embodies a great deal of tap history. 8, Blue Mountain Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 393-1182; suggested donation: $15 to $25.

Museums AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter) Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson) * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberg\u00e9. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck). * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic Art into a final flowering . Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700. (Glueck) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck) Galleries: Uptown * Jasper Johns: 'Flag Drawings' This small, well-selected show of works on paper from private collections -- including Robert Rauschenberg's -- focuses on Mr. Johns's signature motif, the United States flag. Stars and Stripes dating from 1955 to 2000 are finely outlined, densely hatched and sensuously painted. A tiny example from 1957 is made in oil on a birth announcement with the white satin ribbon still attached. One from 2000 reproduces the famous stack of three flags in miniature. Craig F. Starr, 5 East 73rd Street, (212) 570-1739, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections' This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 20. (Johnson) 'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8300, through May 7. (Johnson) 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea BARKELY HENDRICKS: 'BEAUTIFUL LIKE A WOMAN, A REAL WOMAN' An exhibition tracing the artist's transition from still-life paintings to found-object assemblages gets a little too hung up on the female anatomy. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242, through Nov. 12. (Smith) Tim Bavington Modes of the 1960's, like spray-painted stripes and geometrically shaped canvases, are revived in attractive, multipaneled abstractions, but with a contemporary conceptual twist. Mr. Bavington bases his compositional decisions on an obscure system by which he translates passages of old rock music from the aural to the visual. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) Stephen Bush, 'Penetrol' This Australian painter presents partly abstract pictures of rustic cabins in alpine settings. Made in thick, viscous, partly brushed and partly poured enamel and oil paints in hallucinatory hues of hot pink, red and green, they suggest a kind of sentimental romance escalated into a gorgeous but frightening psychotic delusion. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) 'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) Chris Doyle: 'Flight Power Love Tower' A startling, semi-abstract sculpture of a giant, illuminated flying eagle made of slender lengths of wood and long fluorescent lights fills the front exhibition space. One of the amusing stop-action videos in the back shows the artist flying through his studio. Jessica Murray, 150 Eleventh Avenue, near 22nd Street, (212) 633-9606, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) Franklin Evans: 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) ROY LICHTENSTEIN: 'CONVERSATIONS WITH SURREALISM' In its swank, newly opened downtown outpost, a blue-chip uptown gallery is showing eight examples of this famous Pop artist's indelibly cartoonized, also swank borrowings from Surrealism. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, through Nov. 12. (Smith) Kim Simonsson Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, through Nov. 26. (Johnson) Luc Tuymans: 'Proper' In Mr. Tuymans's most accessible show to date, dry, washed-out paintings based on seemingly random photographs add up to a jaundiced, rebuslike portrait of America. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through Nov. 19. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'Eighth Annual International Juried Botanical Art Exhibition' The old-fashioned art of botanical illustration lives on, as evinced by this selection of finely made drawings and watercolors by more than 40 artists. Many are routinely competent, but some, like a small, intense picture of a gnarly root ball by Jean Emmons, are remarkable for both what and how they represent. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through Nov. 18. (Johnson) * Andr\u00e9 KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson) 'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson) * 'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck) * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith). Lynn Talbot, Daniel Zeller In small, lovingly made oil paintings, Ms. Talbot juxtaposes emblematic abstractions and Magic Realist still-lifes to sweetly mystical and seductively sensuous effect. Mr. Zeller continues to draw with maniacally exacting industry small and large abstractions resembling topographical maps by a cartographer from another, possibly microscopic, universe. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Nov. 14. (Johnson) Robert Therrien, 'Table and Six Chairs' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. The Los Angeles-based Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Artium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, through Nov. 28. (Johnson) Zhou Xiaohu The best works in an unfocused presentation of efforts in various media by this versatile Chinese artist are the haunting, darkly comical Claymation videos depicting scenes like the trial of Saddam Hussein, a political assassination and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Ethan Cohen, 18 Jay Street, near Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) Last Chance * 'BARKLEY HENDRICKS: 1972-1983' This uneven show is dominated by the artist's imposing full-length portraits and introduces a series of finely composed and sometimes hand-colored photographs that give a fuller account of the world distilled into his paintings. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 688-1585, closing tomorrow. (Smith) 'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) 'Organic New York' This rewarding show recalls an American trend of the 1940's that was eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism but has been brought back to life by many younger painters today: surrealistic, biomorphic abstraction. It is loaded with swirling, symbolically charged paintings and sculptures by William Baziotes, Lee Krasner, Richard Pousette Dart, Mark Rothko and 15 others. Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) CANDICE BREITZ In four video pieces, the words of Hollywood actresses and actors are reconfigured into a conversation about parenting. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018, closing tomorrow.

Prof. Alan Baker, Swarthmore 1. In setting up his ontological argument for the existence of God, Anselm makes a distinction between ''existing in the understanding'' and ''existing in reality.'' Applying this distinction, if there is a strange, undiscovered species of ant deep in the Amazon rain forest, then this species: a. Exists in reality and exists in the understanding. b. Exists in reality but does not exist in the understanding. c. Does not exist in reality but exists in the understanding. d. Does not exist in reality and does not exist in the understanding. e. May or may not exist in the understanding. 2. ''European peoples in medieval times knew that the earth was flat.'' The most important reason for disagreeing with this claim is that: a. Medieval peoples did not have conclusive proof that the earth was flat. b. There is a Flat Earth Society that continues to have active members today. c. European peoples in medieval times had no direct evidence for thinking that the earth was flat. d. Some members of medieval society believed that the earth was round. e. The earth isn't flat. 3. According to Descartes, ''customs and habits'' do not provide a firm ground for knowledge. His main argument for this claim is that: a. Different customs and habits in different cultures lead to beliefs that conflict with those of other cultures. b. People tend to be less critical of beliefs that are deeply ingrained by customs and habits. c. Customs do not promote ''good sense,'' which is the ability to distinguish true from false. d. The passing down of received opinion from generation to generation distorts the original knowledge and leads to false beliefs. e. Most people in Descartes's time were never exposed to the customs and habits of other regions of the world. 4. Based on what Descartes writes in the first two parts of the ''Discourse on Method,'' the three faculties of mind -- listed in order from the most reliable for acquiring knowledge to the least reliable for acquiring knowledge -- are: a. Imagination; reason; senses. b. Imagination; senses; reason. c. Reason; imagination; senses. d. Reason; senses; imagination. e. Senses; reason; imagination. ''Introduction to Philosophy'' Prof. Gary Varner, Texas A&M 1. In his famous statement ''I think, therefore I am,'' Descartes was arguing that: a. Humans are superior to animals because we think but they do not. b. Because minds have phenomenal consciousness while bodies do not, minds have greater perfection or substance than bodies. c. Even if he was completely mistaken or deceived about all of his thoughts, he could still say with certainty that he exists as a thinking thing, because in order to be mistaken or deceived, he must exist as a mind. 2. Which of the following is the conception of philosophy that is implicit in the abbreviation Ph.D.? a. Being philosophical means reflecting on events intellectually rather than reacting to them emotionally. b. A philosophy is a summary statement of one's general approach to a task or one's opinion on an issue. c. Philosophy is all rational, systematic knowledge. d. Philosophy is, or at least should be, the systematic study of certain non-empirical but enduring questions emphasizing clearly stated arguments and analysis of key terms. 3. Which of the following could a valid argument have? a. False premises and a true conclusion. b. True premises and a true conclusion. c. False premises and a false conclusion. d. Any of the above. e. Either a. or c. but not b. ''Historical Introduction to Western Philosophy'' Prof. Harvey Cormier, SUNY, Stony Brook 1. Kant thinks that the one highest good, the one thing good in itself, is: a. A good will. b. Happiness. c. Reason. d. Love. 2. Identify among the following choices what William James would call a ''living'' option. a. The choice between living in America or living in Europe. b. The choice between being a Republican or being a Democrat. c. The choice between getting married or staying single. d. The question doesn't make sense because what is a living option for one person may not be living for another; ''living-ness'' is subjective. ''Moral Choices'' Prof. Bonnie Steinbock, SUNY, Albany 1. Most people would prefer life in prison to being executed. This does not show that death is a superior deterrent to life in prison because: a. Those who would be deterred from committing a crime by the threat of execution might also be deterred by the lesser punishment of life in prison; while those who were not deterred by the threat of life in prison might not have been deterred by the threat of execution. b. There are some classes of people (e.g., those willing to commit murder for hire) for whom the death penalty would undoubtedly be a significant deterrent. c. Death effectively incapacitates the offender. 2. In Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the death penalty is: a. Permissible in the case of brutal rape. b. Inherently unconstitutional. c. Unconstitutional if arbitrarily and capriciously imposed. 3. If Roe v. Wade were overturned: a. Abortion would become illegal throughout the country. b. Legality of abortion would be a matter of state law. c. The fetus's right to life would be recognized. 4. One difference between the abortion debate and the embryonic stem cell research debate is that: a. Abortion raises the question of the moral status of the embryo while embryonic stem cell research does not. b. There is religious opposition to abortion but not to embryonic stem cell research. c. Abortion raises the issue of bodily self-determination while embryonic stem cell research does not.", "headline": {"main": "I Think, Therefore I Pass", "kicker": "POP QUIZ PHILOSOPHY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "39", "word_count": 947, "_id": "4fd262f88eb7c8105d814c8d", "snippet": " Answers are on Page 42.
