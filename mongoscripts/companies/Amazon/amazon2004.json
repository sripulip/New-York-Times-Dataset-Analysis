The memos featured Diebold employees' candid discussion of flaws in the company's software and warnings that the computer network was poorly protected from hackers. In light of the chaotic 2000 presidential election, the Swarthmore students decided that this information shouldn't be kept from the public. Like aspiring Daniel Ellsbergs with their would-be Pentagon Papers, they posted the files on the Internet, declaring the act a form of electronic whistle-blowing. Unfortunately for the students, their actions ran afoul of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (D.M.C.A.), one of several recent laws that regulate intellectual property and are quietly reshaping the culture. Designed to protect copyrighted material on the Web, the act makes it possible for an Internet service provider to be liable for the material posted by its users -- an extraordinary burden that providers of phone service, by contrast, do not share. Under the law, if an aggrieved party (Diebold, say) threatens to sue an Internet service provider over the content of a subscriber's Web site, the provider can avoid liability simply by removing the offending material.

The temperature of the Thames is too cold to support the fish, though officials sent out a warning that it is illegal to release non-native species into the wild. Patrick E.

Now, 13 years after Craig McCracken first dreamed up the tiny protofeminist crime fighters and six years after they got their own show on the Cartoon Network, he's launched his follow-up project: ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends,'' set in a fantastical Victorian mansion that serves as an orphanage for imaginary friends abandoned by the children who dreamed them into existence. The series, shown on the Cartoon Network on Fridays at 7:30 and repeated throughout the week, goes against the grain of contemporary children's cartoons, which tend either to rely on manic action (like ''The Fairly Odd Parents'') or to revel in gross-out surrealism (''Spongebob Squarepants''). Instead, in the same way that the Lemony Snicket books hark back to the witty Gothic tales of Edward Gorey, ''Foster's Home'' pays loving homage to the cartoons that Mr. McCracken grew up on -- the quirky, hand-painted animation of ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' and ''Underdog.'' Where ''Powerpuff's'' high-speed chases and airborne punch-ups are driven along by frenetic electronic beats, ''Foster's Home'' is set to out-of-time music that Mr. McCracken describes as ''psychedelic ragtime.'' As for the intricate backdrops, he says they are meant to evoke ''that period of late 60's psychedelia when Victorian stylings were coming into trippy poster designs.''

''Is it possible to be nostalgic for a world you never knew?'' Ernesto wonders as he contemplates Inca ruins in the Peruvian highlands. Mr. Salles's film, as ardent and serious a quest as Ernesto's turned out to be, poses a similar question. In making their movie, the cast and crew retraced the route of Granado and Guevara three times, trying to connect not only with the varied, rugged landscape of South America but also with the hopes and confusions of an earlier time: an era before the Cuban revolution, before the military coups and dirty wars of the 1960's and 70's, before the democratic resurgence and economic catastrophes that followed.", "headline": {"main": "On the Road With Young Che", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "A O Scott reviews movie The Motorcycle Diaries, directed by Walter Salles and starring Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna; photos (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1064, "_id": "4fd259a98eb7c8105d805f31", "snippet": "Walter Salles's stirring and warm-hearted film reconstructs a journey across South America taken by Ernesto Guevara before his career as a revolutionary.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/movies/24MOTO.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/09/24/arts/24MOTO.1.75,0.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/09/24/arts/24MOTO.1.75,0.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, THE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GUEVARA, ERNESTO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SALLES, WALTER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DE LA SERNA, RODRIGO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BERNAL, GAEL GARCIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "A.", "middlename": "O.", "lastname": "SCOTT", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By A.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing ''THE BROWN BUNNY,'' starring Vincent Gallo and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. Written and directed by Mr. Gallo (not rated, 92 minutes). Neither an atrocity nor a revelation, ''The Brown Bunny'' is a very watchable, often beautiful-looking attempt by Mr. Gallo to reproduce the kind of loosely structured mood pieces that found American and select foreign-language cinema of the 1960's and 70's often at its most adventurous, with Monte Hellman's 1971 ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' the most obvious touchstone. Mr. Gallo plays Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer (and the title's symbolic bunny) on his way back home to Los Angeles from a New Hampshire meet. As Bud racks up miles, he stares moodily at the road, visits a childhood haunt, eats a lonely meal, sleeps a lonely motel sleep, takes his motorcycle for a spin and exchanges small talk with a few women, who all have the soft, bruised look of chronic disappointment. Eventually Bud hits Los Angeles, where he checks into a hotel, and where yet another flower of femininity, Ms. Sevigny's Daisy, gives the film its back story and furnishes what the porn industry calls, in rather more direct language, its economic raison d'\u00eatre (Manohla Dargis). * ''CELLULAR,'' starring Kim Basinger, Chris Evans and William H. Macy. Directed by David R. Ellis (PG-13, 89 minutes). In this improbable, improbably entertaining action thriller, a Los Angeles science teacher (Ms. Basinger) is kidnapped by a squad of baddies, who lock her in an attic with a telephone that works just well enough for her to connect, at random, with the cellphone of a surfer (Mr. Evans), who spends the rest of the movie trying to rescue her. In an age of self-important, bloated blockbusters, this movie, directed with breeziness and rigor by Mr. Ellis, is a refreshing rarity: an honest, unpretentious B picture, with enough decent jokes, crackerjack car chases and plot convolutions to make the price of the ticket seem like a reasonable bargain. Mr. Macy adds a wry, touching note as the weary L.A.P.D. veteran who helps the surfer in his effort to save the science teacher (A. O. Scott). * ''COLLATERAL,'' starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 115 minutes). In this edgy new thriller from Mr. Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Mr. Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Mr. Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously made commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith (Dargis). ''CRIMINAL,'' starring John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Directed by Gregory Jacobs (R, 87 minutes). Mr. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal in ''Criminal'' of a gimlet-eyed con man allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in ''Chicago'' to leak into his performance. The Mametesque film has strong supporting performances by Mr. Luna, as Mr. Reilly's not-so-na\u00efve prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in swindling, and Ms. Gyllenhaal, as Mr. Reilly's angry sister. The film, a fairly faithful adaptation of the Argentine director Fabian Bielinski's ''Nine Queens,'' is a clever and diverting caper, relocated from South America to Los Angeles. Instead of rare stamps being pursued by assorted grifters and counterfeiters, the priceless fetish being sought is the counterfeit of an 1878 Monroe silver certificate. Mr. Mamet covered roughly the same territory with far more zest and cunning in ''House of Games,'' a movie that unlike ''Criminal'' leaves you with the uneasy sense of living in a world run by diabolically clever thieves gloating over the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of suckers like you and me (Stephen Holden). ''A DIRTY SHAME,'' starring Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville. Written and directed by John Waters (NC-17, 89 minutes). A crashing bore is more like it. Mr. Waters's latest movie once again pits unruly, life-affirming sex maniacs against uptight prudes, here known as neuters. The line between them is blurry: the heroine, Sylvia Stickles (Ms. Ullman), starts out as a repressed suburban mother and, after suffering a concussion, goes on a libidinous rampage. She joins a sex-addict cult (led by Mr. Knoxville), which is devoted to discovering a hitherto undreamed-of kink that will unlock the erotic secrets of the universe. The movie, an anarchic catalog of perversions, sounds like more fun than it is, but Mr. Waters, after more than 35 years of moviemaking, remains a determined amateur, with little interest in acting, storytelling or visual creativity. If his jokes were still funny or his attitudes still provocative, the crudeness of the picture would be less bothersome, but the net effect of all the energetic naughtiness is like that of being in a room full of 8-year-old boys who have just learned some new swear words (Scott). ''THE FORGOTTEN,'' starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise. Directed by Joseph Ruben (PG-13, 100 minutes). In this preposterous thriller, a pseudo-spiritual, mumbo-jumbo, science-fiction inflected mess, Mr. Ruben does not just fail to tap into the talent of his luminous star, Ms. Moore; he barely gets her attention. As Telly, a Brooklyn mother in mourning, Ms. Moore delivers a performance that has all the emotional commitment of a bored kid playing with a light switch. Even after Telly discovers that all the images of her dead son have been erased from the photographs scattered around her home, Ms. Moore keeps flipping the switch: sad, not sad, sad, not sad. Initially, the disappearing images are explained away by Telly's creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Mr. Sinise), who insists that the boy never existed and that after suffering a miscarriage, she invented the boy out of thin air. Telly finds this hard to believe (she isn't the only one) and embarks on a Search for the Truth involving cheap thrills, emotional uplift and some nonsense about the eternal mother (Dargis). * ''GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE,'' with the voices of Akio Otsuka and Atsuko Tanaka. Directed by Mamoru Oshii (PG-13, 99 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Androids don't dream of electric sheep in Mr. Oshii's hallucinatory meditation on life in the shadow of the machine world. They dream of suicide, an unlikely act of violence that one android or ''gynoid,'' a sexual pet with a tragic face and luridly flexible limbs, commits by clawing at its synthetic skin as if it were a grieving widow. This movie is a sequel to the Japanese filmmaker's 1995 anime, ''Ghost in the Shell,'' about a female detective who inhabits and then loses her artificial body. Set in 2032, the new anime centers on her former colleague, the stone-faced cyborg Batou, a male cop in a future-shock world where sex dolls commit virtual seppuku against a swirl of film-noir intrigue, philosophical speculation, eye-popping images and serious science-fiction cool, and where machines often seem more human their human masters (Dargis). * ''THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES,'' starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952, Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon (Scott). * ''RED LIGHTS,'' starring Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet. Directed by C\u00e9dric Kahn (not rated, 106 minutes; in French with English subtitles). This brilliant, sinister French thriller is a twisty road movie in which every sign points toward catastrophe. As night falls during the journey of an unhappily married couple from Paris to Bordeaux, the clogged highway takes them into descending levels of psychosexual hell. Mr. Darroussin's Antoine is a mousy, balding insurance salesman who hates his job and resents his more successful wife, a sleek corporate lawyer. The movie is a study of male passive aggression that comes up with a malicious Hemingwayesque solution to Antoine's masculinity crisis. When his wife, fed up with his drinking on the road, deserts him to take the train, he picks up a hitchhiker he knows may be a dangerous escaped convict and courts the redemptive (and grisly) male rite of passage he's been seeking. Following Jean-Luc Godard's ''Weekend'' and Claire Denis's ''Friday Night,'' ''Red Lights'' uses the traffic jam as a potent screen metaphor for something bigger (Holden). ''SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,'' starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. Written and directed by Kerry Conran (PG, 107 minutes). In this movie's elegant murk, Mr. Law and Ms. Paltrow slip into comic-book archetypes of the dashing aviator and the intrepid girl reporter with supreme confidence. But can the movie establish a swashbuckling franchise as commercially potent as the Indiana Jones movies? When Mr. Conran's remarkable filmmaking debut remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, the movie charms as well as impresses. If nothing else, it is a landmark of computer-generated images whose actors cavort through an entirely synthetic, retro-styled future world that fuses Art Deco, Futurism, Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis'' and the spirit of the 1939 World's Fair into an all-purpose eve-of-World War II environment extrapolated into a science-fiction limbo. But its visual elegance comes at a price. Its ethereal evocation of a pulp-fiction future-past eclipses almost any other sci-fi franchise in subtlety and imagination, but shadowy washed-out color is a far cry from the robust hues of a movie like ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' At times, it's hard to see what's on the screen (Holden). ''VANITY FAIR,'' starring Reese Witherspoon, Eileen Atkins, Jim Broadbent, Gabriel Byrne, Romola Garai and James Purefoy. Directed by Mira Nair (PG-13, 141 minutes). Her eyes snapping like tiny firecrackers, Ms. Witherspoon makes an appealingly crafty Becky Sharp in Ms. Nair's bland but color-drenched screen adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel. The star, as usual, conveys a bristly, determined spunk. But if her performance emits enough sparks to hold the screen, it never ignites a dramatic brush fire. You long for more Scarlett O'Hara and less Elle Woods. Her Becky comes across as a lightweight schemer about as formidable as an aspiring trophy wife on a daytime soap. In compressing a novel that spans three decades of the early 19th century, the movie becomes increasingly hurried and eventually loses track of time, and in trying to mix satire and romance, it proves once again that the two are about as compatible as lemon juice and heavy cream. It flashes to comic life in those scenes that convey Thackeray's disdain for the preening foolishness and snobbery of early 19th-century English society and the crass symbiotic relationship between money and aristocracy. Then, as now, you could buy your way to the top (Holden). ''WIMBLEDON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany. Directed by Richard Loncraine (PG-13, 100 minutes). Will pregame sexual high jinks give you the edge you need to win at tennis? Or will they distract you from mobilizing the killer instinct necessary to blast through to victory? That's the earth-shattering question at the heart of ''Wimbledon,'' a likable, formulaic sports movie that follows the miraculous comeback of an insecure 31-year-old British tennis pro named Peter (Mr. Bettany), whose career resurrects on the wings of love. At Wimbledon, where he's playing his final professional matches, he meets and falls in love with Lizzie, a super-competitive American pro (Ms. Dunst) on the fast track to the women's championship. She appears unstoppable until Peter enters her life. The moment her defenses start to crumble, her concentration falters. As the trajectories of their careers reverse, Peter credits Lizzie with spurring his triumphs, while she bitterly blames him for her fall from grace. The film's most refreshing idea is to present a male sports hero who doesn't see himself primarily as an invincible fighting machine. He is courtly, witty, sensitive and apologetic to a fault (Holden).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 2237, "_id": "4fd23e578eb7c8105d7d4d46", "snippet": " A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.

Some of these are neglected masterpieces, while others are half-forgotten curiosities. At first glance, ''Macuna\u00edma,'' Joaquim Pedro de Andrade's 1969 Brazilian picaresque, seems to fit most comfortably in the second category. A dubbed English-language version, titled ''Jungle Freaks,'' had a brief exploitation-house run in 1972, and audiences who see the festival's pristine new subtitled print will understand why. With its over-the-top, farcical acting, its frequent nudity and its hang-loose, anarchic vibe, ''Macuna\u00edma,'' which will be shown tonight at 8:15 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, survives as a gloriously demented artifact of its time. Connoisseurs might detect a touch of Felliniesque rococo, but this magical-realist mock-epic commingles more comfortably in less exalted company, with the films of John Waters and Russ Meyers, perhaps, or with lost episodes of ''The Monkees.'' Which is not to say that the film, adapted from a 1928 novel by M\u00e1rio de Andrade (no relation to the director) is lacking in seriousness. Underneath it all is a meditation on the riddles of Brazilian identity and the agonies of Brazilian politics. In 1969, Brazil was in the grip of a military dictatorship, and ''Macuna\u00edma,'' one of whose minor characters is a sexy urban guerilla, hums with a joyful and pointed anti-authoritarian spirit.", "headline": {"main": "A Tall Brazilian Tale in Black, White and Many Colors", "kicker": "CRITIC'S CHOICE: FILM FESTIVAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "word_count": 382, "_id": "4fd259ad8eb7c8105d80611f", "snippet": "Joaquim Pedro de Andrade's 1969 Brazilian picaresque, which is being shown at the New York Film Festival, survives as a gloriously demented artifact of its time.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/movies/06macu.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/10/06/arts/06maca.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/10/06/arts/06maca.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "MACUNAIMA (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "A.", "middlename": "O.", "lastname": "SCOTT", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By A.O.

Now Playing * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952, Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.

This heavily padded, thinly conceived, well-meaning movie about four generations of men stars Josh Lucas as Jason, a single parent raising an only son, Zach (Jonah Bobo), and caring for his querulous, sickly grandfather, Henry (Mr. Caine). Decades earlier, Jason's father, Turner (Mr. Walken), had abandoned his son and delivered him into Henry's loving care. Then one day Turner materializes on the front door. Jason initially rejects his father, but because blood is thicker than water, if only in the fantasy worlds of mainstream fiction and self-help books, reconciliation looms. Will Jason learn to trust Turner? Will Turner explain why he abandoned Jason? Will Mr. Walken deliver one of his patented eccentric performances? Will the screenplay explain Mr. Caine's on-and-off Cockney accent? The answers, in order, are yes, yes, yes and no. MANOHLA DARGIS * 'CELLULAR' Starring Kim Basinger, Chris Evans and William H. Macy. Directed by David R. Ellis (PG-13, 89 minutes). In this improbable, improbably entertaining action thriller, a Los Angeles science teacher (Ms. Basinger) is kidnapped by a squad of baddies, who lock her in an attic with a telephone that works just well enough for her to connect, at random, with the cellphone of a surfer (Mr. Evans), who spends the rest of the movie trying to rescue her. In an age of self-important, bloated blockbusters, this movie, directed with breeziness and rigor by Mr. Ellis, is a refreshing rarity: an honest, unpretentious B picture, with enough decent jokes, crackerjack car chases and plot convolutions to make the price of the ticket seem like a reasonable bargain. Mr. Macy adds a wry, touching note as the weary L.A.P.D. veteran who helps the surfer in his effort to save the science teacher. A. O. SCOTT 'A DIRTY SHAME' Starring Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville. Written and directed by John Waters (NC-17, 89 minutes). A crashing bore is more like it. Mr. Waters's latest movie once again pits unruly, life-affirming sex maniacs against uptight prudes, here known as neuters. The line between them is blurry: the heroine, Sylvia Stickles (Ms. Ullman), starts out as a repressed suburban mother and, after suffering a concussion, goes on a libidinous rampage. She joins a sex-addict cult (led by Mr. Knoxville), which is devoted to discovering a hitherto undreamed-of kink that will unlock the erotic secrets of the universe. The movie, an anarchic catalog of perversions, sounds like more fun than it is, but Mr. Waters, after more than 35 years of moviemaking, remains a determined amateur, with little interest in acting, storytelling or visual creativity. If his jokes were still funny or his attitudes still provocative, the crudeness of the picture would be less bothersome, but the net effect of all the energetic naughtiness is like that of being in a room full of 8-year-old boys who have just learned some new swear words. SCOTT 'THE FORGOTTEN' Starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise. Directed by Joseph Ruben (PG-13, 100 minutes). In this preposterous thriller, a pseudo-spiritual, mumbo-jumbo, sciencefiction-inflected mess, Mr. Ruben does not just fail to tap into the talent of his luminous star, Ms. Moore; he barely gets her attention. As Telly, a Brooklyn mother in mourning, Ms. Moore delivers a performance that has all the emotional commitment of a bored kid playing with a light switch. Even after Telly discovers that all the images of her dead son have been erased from the photographs scattered around her home, Ms. Moore keeps flipping the switch: sad, not sad, sad, not sad. Initially, the disappearing images are explained away by Telly's creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Mr. Sinise), who insists that the boy never existed and that after suffering a miscarriage, she invented him out of thin air. Telly finds this hard to believe (she isn't the only one) and embarks on a Search for the Truth involving cheap thrills, emotional uplift and some nonsense about the eternal mother. DARGIS 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganze in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback. SCOTT * 'I HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope. DARGIS 'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism. DARGIS * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952, Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'RAISE YOUR VOICE' Starring Hilary Duff. Directed by Sean McNamara (PG, 97 minutes). Ms. Duff, as Terri Fletcher, redefines the word ''pep.'' But when tragedy strikes her family, Terri loses her voice (her great joy is singing) and her love of life. The only thing that might snap her out of it would be attending a very hard to get into summer-music program in Los Angeles, but her hardheaded father (David Keith) objects. It takes deception and the help of a free-spirited aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) to get her there. Predictably, the big city lives up to its bad reputation at first, but chances are good that Terri will find her voice again, teach her parents a lesson and get the guy (Oliver James). Thinking adults won't find much of ''Raise Your Voice'' worth their time, but this piece of fluff's infectious high spirits will appeal to young moviegoers without conveying any sinister messages, beyond the suggestion that soul-crushing grief can be ''cured'' in the short space of a summer. ANITA GATES 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT 'SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW' Starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. Written and directed by Kerry Conran (PG, 107 minutes). In this movie's elegant murk, Mr. Law and Ms. Paltrow slip into comic-book archetypes of the dashing aviator and the intrepid girl reporter with supreme confidence. But can the movie establish a swashbuckling franchise as commercially potent as the Indiana Jones movies? When Mr. Conran's remarkable filmmaking debut remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, the movie charms as well as impresses. If nothing else, it is a landmark of computer-generated images, with actors cavorting through an entirely synthetic, retro-styled future world that fuses Art Deco, Futurism, Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis'' and the spirit of the 1939 World's Fair into an all-purpose eve-of-World War II environment extrapolated into a science-fiction limbo. But its visual elegance comes at a price. Its ethereal evocation of a pulp-fiction future-past eclipses almost any other sci-fi franchise in subtlety and imagination, but shadowy washed-out color is a far cry from the robust hues of a movie like ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' STEPHEN HOLDEN 'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who speciallizes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women. SCOTT 'TAXI' Starring Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah. Directed by Tim Story (PG-13, 97 minutes). With his driver's license revoked, a New York cop (Mr. Fallon) teams up with a taxi driver (Queen Latifah) -- whose Yellow Cab has a supercharged engine under the hood -- to track down a gang of bank robbers, composed of leggy Brazilian models led by the leggy Brazilian model Gisele B\u00fcndchen. A tired, clich\u00e9-ridden remake of a 1998 French production of the same name, Mr. Story's film ends abruptly, as if he'd walked out on his own picture -- something many viewers will be tempted to do as well. DAVE KEHR * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Pop/Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. CMJ shows are noted. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent pop and jazz performances: nytimes.com/music. * MARC ANTHONY, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Marc Anthony pines for romance with one of the most ardent voices in pop: a tenor that starts out seeming hesitant and rises to pealing, sobbing notes that hold on to their gentleness even at full power. His songs in English have been more awkward than his salsa hits in Spanish. His most recent album, ''Amar Sin Mentiras'' (Sony), leans heavily on the ballads, but there's no denying his combination of boyish charm and supercharged supplication. Sunday night at 6; tickets are $99.50. JON PARELES CLAUDIA ACU\u00d1A, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street,West Village, (212) 255-3626. Ms. Acu\u00f1a, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or, better yet, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, and they play around with mambos, Middle Eastern scales and improvising that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum. BEN RATLIFF * EVA AYLLON, TownHall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824. Afro-Peruvian music, which imported African rhythms into Spanish and Andean song, became popular in Peru during the 1970's and 80's, when many South American countries were discovering their cultural roots. Eva Ayllon is one of the best musicians to come out of it, a strong and outrageously good singer whose songs move between waltzes and the Afro-Peruvian rhythms called lando and festejo. Her music also has the dramatic temper of out-and-out romantic pop, and at the heart of her band are three drummers. Her repertory is filled with references to black and Peruvian pride; the first song on her new album, ''Eva! Leyenda Peruana'' (Times Square), is a semi-autobiographical lando called ''Negra Presuntuosa'' (''The Presumptuous Black Woman''). She is internationalizing herself; this is her first North American tour that isn't playing specifically to Peruvian communities. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 to $45. RATLIFF * RAY BARRETTO 75th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. After a long career playing with jazz and salsa bands and various other bands in between, the great conga player Ray Barretto will tell you that he plays jazz, full stop. But here he is, for a significant birthday-week gig, connecting with conga players who represent 60 years of Afro-Cuban roots music and Latin jazz: Candido Camero, Patato Valdes and Giovanni Hidalgo. Kenny Garrett, a jazz alto saxophonist who has nothing to do with Latin music per se, will be another guest. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30 and there is a $5 minimum. RATLIFF CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN/CRACKER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Camper Van Beethoven, the California band that played deadpan mixtures of folk-rock, reggae, klezmer and anything else its songwriters felt like toying with, spawned so many offshoots that the band itself may not be able to keep track of them. After leading Cracker for much of the 1990's, David Lowery reconvened Camper Van Beethoven, which has made a new album, ''New Roman Times'' (Pitch a Tent), that's a rock opera about a soldier. Camper and Cracker are both gathered tonight, with Johnny Hickmen of Cracker at 6:30, Cracker at 6:40, Jonathan Segel and Victor Krummenacher from Camper at 7:50 and Camper Van Beethoven at 8. A CMJ show; tickets are $15. PARELES BILLY COBHAM CULTURE MIX, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Cobham, drummer extraordinaire for the old Mahavishnu Orchestra, long ago decided to use a wide canvas: jazz, rock and funk. This week he plays with a group that includes the percussionist Airto Moreira and the trumpeter Randy Brecker. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF THE CRAMPS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Cramps have been scrambling punk, goth, twang and B-movie memories into their own frenzied psychobilly music since the mid-1970's. Sunday night at 8, with the Chesterfield Kings and Dead Combo; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 Sunday. PARELES * DR. JOHN/SHEMEKIA COPELAND/CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE, Bardavon Opera House, 35 Market Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845) 473-2072. Three very different takes on the blues. Dr. John is the growly-voiced New Orleans piano wizard who splashes barrelhouse flourishes over songs that could hold voodoo secrets. Shemekia Copeland sings in a gutsy but girlish voice about men and their many flaws, from indifference to infidelity. Charlie Musselwhite has been a celebrated harmonica player since the 1960's, and on his most recent album, ''Sanctuary'' (Real World), he lets his conversational voice contemplate memories and mortality before reaching for deep blues with his harmonica. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $42.50. PARELES ELIANE ELIAS, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Elias, the Brazilian pianist who fuses the main line of postwar jazz with Latin American rhythms and song forms, has been one of the more interesting crosscultural musicians on the New York scene; her group can hit hard, escaping the languidness of so much Brazilian jazz. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10 and tomorrow night at 11; cover charge is $40. RATLIFF FANTCHA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Fantcha sings mornas, the lilting, wistful, piquantly mournful songs from the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Senegal. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the best-known Cape Verdean singer, Cesaria Evora, she has learned some of the secrets of morna's amiable melancholy. Tomorrow night at 10; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 tomorrow. PARELES DAVE FRISHBERG AND JAY LEONHARDT, Birdland, 131 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. Two jazz performers with clever senses of humor, who have compiled a body of sly songs -- many of them about playing jazz and living the jazz life. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF 'THE JAZZ MASTERS,' Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 463-7700. Barry Harris, Jimmy Heath, Percy Heath, Clark Terry, Benny Powell, Winard Harper -- all but Mr. Harper are among the most venerable living jazz musicians. A concert involving all six will involve bonhomie and some secrets of the old-school performance style. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30; $24 for members. RATLIFF * JIMMY EAT WORLD, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-5252. Jimmy Eat World was an early standard-bearer for emo, adding emotional and musical complications to punk-rock while never resisting a good hook. It's about to resist its next album, ''Futures'' (Interscope). Tonight at 8, with Robbers on High Street and the Oranges Band; tickets are $22. PARELES JON LANGFORD'S SHIP AND PILOT, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Jon Langford of the Mekons brings one of his many side projects, Ship and Pilot, backing him as he bawls his way through songs full of history, surrealism and twang. Tonight at midnight, headlining a CMJ show that also includes Meat Purveyors at 11, the Fandanglers at 10, Carolyn Mark at 9 and the Cobble Hillbillies at 8; admission is $8. PARELES RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Malone, who played guitar with Diana Krall, brings the virtuosity of a stricter, older period in jazz; he can play a slow blues beautifully and then play ridiculously fast four-bar breaks. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF * BETTE MIDLER, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777. This voracious, wildly energetic entertainer blows into town for two performances of ''Kiss My Brass,'' her clever, freewheeling current show. Shameless dirty jokes, tear-jerking ballads, sly political digs and -- of course -- mermaids in wheelchairs: she rarely seems any more (or any less) than half serious, even when she's crooning about that famous wind beneath those famous wings. (Has there ever been a more mean-spirited tribute to a friend?) Ms. Midler makes other, more single-minded performers seem stodgy by comparison. Tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8; tickets are $70 to $255. KELEFA SANNEH ALEXI MURDOCH/MIKE DOUGHTY, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Alexi Murdoch's songs seek quiet revelations, harking back to folky, introspective songwriters like Nick Drake and John Martyn. Mike Doughty, whose wisecracking neo-Beat rapped lyrics were the core of Soul Coughing, is on his own now, still droll and rhyming. A CMJ show, tomorrow night at 7, with Hotel Lights opening; admission is $12. PARELES DAVID FATHEAD NEWMAN QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Newman, the saxophonist, is one of the figures who led jazz toward pop in the 1960's, as Ray Charles's right-hand man in Charles's band's greatest years and a maker of consistent solo records for Atlantic. He has maintained his smoothness, and he is also a master of the blues. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20. RATLIFF ONE NIGHT WITH LITE, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, 7th Avenue at 32nd Street, (212) 465-6741. An eminently risible concert, sponsored by Lite 106.7 FM, starring Josh Groban, John Ondrasik of Five for Fighting and Celine Dion. (Wasn't she supposed to be safely sequestered in Las Vegas? And how could her high-carb ballads possibly qualify as ''lite''?) But if you should somehow find yourself in the Theater at Madison Square Garden tonight, take heart: the lineup includes the nimble and elegant country singer Martina McBride, who should easily steal the show, even though her music isn't ''lite'' at all. Tonight at 8; tickets are $79.50 to $354.50. SANNEH * OUTPUTMESSAGE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. An emerging electronic producer who has released a handful of suave but angular tracks, letting jagged, asymmetrical rhythms collide with fizzy bits of melody; expect to hear disjointed pop songs and dry rhythm tracks seeping out of his laptop. Tonight at 9, as part of the CMJ Music Marathon; tickets are $10. SANNEH * ERIC REED QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The pianist Mr. Reed has been working on increasingly sophisticated versions of small-group jazz over the last 10 years or so; he has written a ton of original compositions, with precise arrangements, in styles ranging from ragtime to gospel to uptempo swing. His band includes the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonist Seamus Blake, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF STAN RIDGWAY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212 239-6200. A Hollywood film-noir sensibility runs through Stan Ridgway's rock songs, which are full of characters in trouble and smoky ambience. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $25. PARELES SASHA, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. A top-dollar club night starring Sasha, a D.J. who pleases huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them: eschewing both the obvious and the unusual, he tops his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. Tonight after 10, with D.J. Three; tickets are $40. SANNEH SINGAPORE SLING/LOW FLYING OWLS, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Singapore Sling, a band from Iceland, has been listening to glam-rock and Jesus and Mary Chain; it's devoted to drones overlaid with late-night decadence. Low Flying Owls, from California, revive psychedelia with all its drones and feedback, adding a little punk bite. Tomorrow night, Low Flying Owls at 9:30 and Singapore Sling at 11:30, on a CMJ show with Looker at 7:30, Another Blue door at 8:30, Benzos at 10:30 and Viva K at 12:30 a.m.; admission is $10. PARELES SOCIAL DISTORTION, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Social Distortion came out of the Southern California punk explosion of the late 1970's and stuck around. By now, its buzzsaw chords and minor-key melodies have taken on a tinge of roots-rock, and Mike Ness has moved from singing about youthful frustrations to pondering adult choices and consequences. Tonight at 7, with two younger punk bands, Tiger Army and Explosions, opening; tickets are $30. PARELES SONIC BOOM'S E.A.R., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street between Richards and Columbia Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007. Sonic Boom, formerly of Spacemen 3, loves the trippy sounds of echoes and distortion and the swoops of synthesizers and theremin; his Experimental Audio Research takes its time with long, abstract jams. Tomorrow night at midnight, on a CMJ bill with Landing at 10 and Paik at 9; admission is $10. PARELES * REGINA SPEKTOR/THE MENDOZA LINE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Regina Spektor plays spare, precise piano and sings in the voice of a very wise child: one who knows about sex, guns, despair and euphoria. She can come across as a sly combination of Rickie Lee Jones, Meredith Monk and Bjork. The Mendoza Line brings touches of country to the disheveled collegiate-rock of Pavement, ending up somewhere near Wilco in the realm of tarnished roots-rock. Unlike Wilco, the Mendoza Line focuses on the ways relationships crumble, summing them up in lines like ''We're all in this alone.'' Tomorrow, with Ms. Spektor at 10 and the Mendoza Line at 11, preceded by Zykos at 8 and the Fontaine Toups at 9. A CMJ show; admission is $12. PARELES * SUFJAN STEVENS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Last year, this captivating singer-songwriter released ''Greetings From Michigan: The Great Lake State'' (Asthmatic Kitty), which he claimed was the first in a series of albums about all the states. Having completed 2 percent of his task, he switched directions and released the stripped-down ''Seven Swans'' (Sounds Familyre), a gorgeous, hushed CD full of glowing songs of love and faith. Tonight at 12:30 a.m., as part of the CMJ Music Marathon; tickets are $14. SANNEH * THE THERMALS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This gleeful but squint-eyed punk trio bashes out deceptively simple songs, wriggling and wriggling as if trying to escape a very small box. Visit http://www.thethermals.com/videos.html to watch the addictive, low-concept video for ''How We Know,'' a recent single. Tomorrow night at midnight, at the Sub Pop Records CMJ Showcase, a sure-to-be-packed concert that also stars Low, the Helio Sequence, Frausdots and Sam Jayne; tickets are $12. SANNEH MARY TIMONY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. Tonight at 10:15, on a CMJ bill that also includes Manhunter at 8, Food for Animals at 8:45, Channels at 9:30, El Guapo at 11 and Q and not U at midnight; admission is $12. PARELES * ROKIA TRAORE, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Rokia Traore, from Mali, has a voice that's both delicate and impassioned. Her songs are cat's-cradles of circling guitar lines, marimba patterns and rhythms tapped on a calabash; her new album, ''Bombwoi'' (Nonesuch) also uses a string quartet. Ms. Traore subtly updates traditional styles while holding to their intricate clarity. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $28 to $35. PARELES TV ON THE RADIO/SALLY TIMMS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. TV on the Radio is a New York art-rock band to the core, reaching back to the frenzied minimalism of the Velvet Underground and adding its own eerie, poetic overlay. Sally Timms, the longtime vocalist of the Mekons, has a matter-of-factly melancholy voice and a repertory that extends from quasi-country to the songs about masculinity from her new album, ''The World of Him'' (Touch and Go). Tonight, TV on the Radio at 12:45 and Ms. Timms at 9:30, along with Tara Jane O'Neil at 8, Whirlwind Head at 8:45. Battles at 10:20 and Pinback at 11:25. A CMJ show; admission is $22.50. PARELES THE TWILIGHT SINGERS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Greg Dulli led the Afghan Whigs before he started the more introspective Twilight Singers, who help him wallow in loneliness and romantic insecurity as he confesses all in his smoky voice. The group's new album, ''She Loves You'' (One Little Indian Us), is a collection of other people's songs, from Bjork to Mary J. Blige to Gershwin. Tomorrow night at midnight; tickets are $20. PARELES ADAM ROGERS QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Mr. Rogers is easily one of the best jazz guitarists in New York, the next step in the tradition of swinging mainstream players -- in the line of Pat Martino and George Benson, though he can rock and play country as well. This weekend he appears with the pianist Edward Simon, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Clarence Penn. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15. RATLIFF VON BONDIES, Plaid, 76 East 13th Street, Manhattan, (212) 388-1060. Throwbacks and proud of it, the Von Bondies play garage-rock songs that are all riff and muscle: just three or four chords, a brawny beat, and something for Jason Stollsteimer to howl. Tonight at 11, in a CMJ show that also includes Idiot Pilot at 8, the Crimea at 8:45, the Sun at 9:30, Rolling Blackouts at 10:15 and Mean Reds at midnight. Admission: $25. PARELES THE FAINT -- This weekend, the CMJ Music Marathon invades the downtown nightclubs, bringing together enough indie-rockers from around the country to repopulate Williamsburg several times over. (Visit http://www.cmj.com/marathon/showcase.php for the full schedule.) The Faint, new-wave revivalists from Omaha, come to town to play two of the weekend's most eagerly anticipated concerts -- a CMJ showcase tonight and a concert tomorrow night that's not affiliated with the Marathon. The band's new album is ''Wet From Birth'' (Saddle Creek), an inventive, sometimes awkward CD driven by saw-toothed bass lines and flat, uneasy vocals. On ''How Could I Forget'' and ''Paranoiattack,'' the band explores a jagged, mutated version of house music, but elsewhere, the singer Todd Baechle often adds lyrics that are either too ridiculous or not ridiculous enough. (It's hard to tell; what's clear is that the phrase ''tunnel of mucus'' should never have been committed to tape.) Still, expect a propulsive, theatrical show, with the band members wobbling their knees in time to the beat as patterns and icons flicker on the huge screens behind them. (Tonight at 6 with the Good Life; Beep Beep; Son, Ambulance; and Broken Spindles. Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Tickets are $20; a limited number of CMJ badge holders will also be admitted. Tomorrow night at 7:30 with TV on the Radio and Beep Beep; tickets are $20, no CMJ badgeholders will be admitted.) KELEFA SANNEH Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. STEPHEN HOLDEN ELIANE ELIAS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. The Brazilian pianist and singer Eliane Elias commands the keyboard with a forceful two-handed muscularity that belies her image as a blonde older sister of the mythical Girl From Ipanema. The more percussive her pianism becomes, the more she opens up a song and re-positions it in what might be called a romantic carnival groove. The more aggressively she and her band (Marc Johnson on bass, Rubens de la Corte on guitar and Paulo Braga on drums) rub up against the formal structures of pop samba, the better they sound. Tonight at 8 and 10:30 and tomorrow night at 11. Cover $40; no minimum. HOLDEN PHILLIP OFFICER, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. Mr. Officer is a font of optimism. Even when the storm clouds are dumping buckets of rain on his head, he would rather peer into the distance and discern the hazy outlines of a rainbow on the horizon. What keeps the singing of this light but steady baritone from becoming insistently cloying is his musicality and connoisseurship of songs from many decades, which he likes to weave into odd but smart combinations (e.g. Van Morrison's ''Moondance'' with Irving Berlin's ''Let Yourself Go''); Barry Levitt charges behind on piano. Sunday at 2 p.m. Cover: $20; two-drink minimum. HOLDEN SANDY STEWART AND BILL CHARLAP, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. There are moments when the singer Sandy Stewart resembles the great French actress Simone Signornet in her later years. Life's heartbreaks and tragedies have been absorbed and folded into a maternal persona that exudes comfort, wisdom and a humming serenity only rarely interrupted by moments of alarm. Her son, Mr. Charlap, who accompanies on piano and takes his own brief solo set, is a brilliant jazz whiz who shares his mother's no-frills sense of musical discretion. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $50 prix-fixe dinner requred at the early shows; two drink-minimum at the late shows. HOLDEN Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The character's an innocent teenage maiden, but the role requires a voice that can run the gamut from limpid to stentorian, all at considerable volume. By the end of the evening it's usually pretty clear who's won: tomorrow night's contender, taking on Verdi's Ethiopian slave girl in the Metropolitan Opera revival, is Fiorenza Cedolins. She's appearing with other singers capable of mighty if not always accurate sounds, Franco Farina (as Radam\u00e8s) and Juan Pons (as her father Amonasro); while the redoubtable Dolora Zajick will reprise one of her signature scene-stealing Verdi mezzo roles, Amneris. Marcello Viotti conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $40 to $215. ANNE MIDGETTE 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' You can do almost anything to Puccini's best-loved opera -- even move it to the East Village (see ''Rent''). James Robinson's production at City Opera doesn't go that far; but it does nudge the action up to the eve of World War I, so that Grant Youngblood's full-bodied Marcello adorns the walls of the Bohemians' garret with bright Fauve-like colors, and Colline (Matthew Burns) demonstrates against the war. In this revival (which ends its run tonight), Jorge Antonio Pita's Rodolfo sounds strained; Angela Marambio is a warm Mimi, and, although the production has lost some of its starch over the years, Mimi's death remains an effective tear-jerker. Steven White conducts. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27.50 to $105.50. MIDGETTE 'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty op\u00e9ra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some extra motion comes into the picture tomorrow as new singers step into the lead roles: Maria Domashenko takes on Carmen, and Fabio Armiliato sings Don Jos\u00e9. An additional tenor joins the cast, but in the pit: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Mica\u00ebla, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. MIDGETTE 'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES' The New York City Opera's new production of Poulenc's tragic opera continues its run at the New York State Theater. From a career of composing filled with the shrewd, the witty, the tender and the generally lighthearted, Poulenc has also left us this deeply serious opera and the questions it asks about faith and revolution. Definitely worth a trip. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50. BERNARD HOLLAND 'FALSTAFF' Diminutive it may be, but you can't say it's not ambitious: the Dicapo Opera, in an underground theater in a church basement, is staging Verdi's final opera, a comic masterpiece that happens to be fiendishly difficult, as its first production of this season. Just to make it more difficult, Michael Capasso, the company's co-founder, is updating the action to Brooklyn and evoking the spirit of 1950's sit-coms: such updating either works or really, really doesn't. Amanda Winfield, David Malis and Richard Byrne lead the cast; Pacien Mazzagatti conducts. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50. MIDGETTE * 'PLAT\u00c9E' There is an element of meanness in Rameau's ''Plat\u00e9e,'' the French baroque com\u00e9die-lyrique, which has returned to the New York City Opera in Mark Morris's enchanting production. Mr. Morris, who directed and choreographed the work, does not shy away from the cruelty in the story, which surely is just as Rameau intended. To teach his jealous wife Juno a lesson, Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Plat\u00e9e, a homely, part-amphibian marsh nymph who carries on like the grand dame of the swamp creatures. As costumed by Isaac Mizrahi, Plat\u00e9e may look ridiculous, with her frog skin, webbed feet and hands, and a sagging breast and tummy disguised by a sheer greenish gown. But as played by the diminutive and riveting tenor Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court, Plat\u00e9e is an endearing diva. It's funny, yes, but heartbreaking to see her so blithely duped. The winning cast includes members of the Mark Morris Dance Group, wildly costumed as frogs, snakes, nymphs and such. Daniel Beckwith conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50. ANTHONY TOMMASINI 'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E-flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. She's joined tomorrow by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. The matinee will also mark the company debut of a young conductor named Ari Pelto. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32.50 to $115.50. MIDGETTE Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA When Bruno Walter (born in 1876) and Hans Pfitzner (born 1869) were leading young figures in German music, each was a composer and a conductor. Walter left composing behind as conducting took over his life. Eventually Walter left Pfitzner behind as well when he emigrated to America, never forgiving his former colleague for his Nazi sympathies. ''A Complicated Friendship'' is the title of the program Leon Botstein will conduct tonight in which this relationship is explored. Performances of Pfitzner's ''Palestrina'' Preludes and his Violin Concerto (with Alexander Markov as soloist) will be followed by the first performance in half a century, according to Mr. Botstein, of Bruno Walter's Symphony No. 1, which dates from 1907. Tonight at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53. TOMMASINI BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, the pianist Olga Vinokur offers an all-Russian program of works by Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Medtner and others. Tomorrow night and Sunday will bring chamber music programs, including Smetana's smoldering G-minor Trio and Cindy McTee's ''Circle Music I,'' a work designed like a choose-your-own-adventure novel with the performers deciding individually which route to take through the music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20. JEREMY EICHLER LEONARDO CAPALBO As part of its important work supporting young singers in recital appearances across the United States, the Marilyn Horne Foundation offers a series of intimate and popular voice recitals in New York. This season's series begins on Sunday afternoon with the tenor Leonardo Capalbo, a graduate of Juilliard and the Music Academy of the West (where he studied with Ms. Horne). Mr. Capalbo, who enjoyed recent success in appearances with Opera North in England, will perform songs by Bellini, Mascagni, Liszt, Quilter and others, accompanied by the pianist Jonathan Kelly. Sunday at 3 p.m., the Chapel at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, (212) 378-0248. Tickets: $20,$15 for 65+ and free for students TOMMASINI * FLOATING WORLDS: GEORGE CRUMB/FERNANDO VELAZQUEZ With its striking colors, bold gestures and brilliant use of extended instrumental techniques, George Crumb's music has always invited a level of visual engagement. So perhaps it's not surprising that a contemporary painter has accepted the invitation. The London-based artist Fernando Velazquez has responded to Mr. Crumb's music with an 8-by-12-foot painting that will be presented for the first time this evening as accompaniment to an all-Crumb program performed by the enterprising International Contemporary Ensemble and the soprano Tony Arnold. Among the works featured will be the ''Vox Balaenae'' (1971), inspired by whale song, and a more recent solo piano work ''Eine Kleine Mitternachtmusik.'' Tonight at 8:30, Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $21; $18 for students and 65+. JEREMY EICHLER WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR If, for whatever reason, Lincoln Center declares it a Brahms season, it's a Brahms season. The big guns will be the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the Dresden Philharmonic in the four symphonies. But the Great Performers series ''The Classical Romantic'' begins more modestly with the excellent Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair presenting an array of Brahms songs, including some of the exquisite settings of German folk songs, too seldom heard. As in all Brahms songs, Russell Ryan, the pianist, will play a crucial role. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $48. JAMES R. OESTREICH GREAT MUSIC FOR A GREAT CITY One measure of a city's greatness may be the amount of free music available on any given night, and in those terms, New York scores high, especially with all the concerts at local conservatories. Even so, this free series in Midtown is a welcome addition to the city's wallet-friendly offerings. Many of its fall concerts are devoted to American music, including tomorrow night's program of works by Gershwin, Ellington, Copland and Bernstein. Tomorrow night at 7:30, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 817-8215. Free; paid reservations are available. EICHLER GUARNERI STRING QUARTET This ensemble, founded in 1964 and long a pillar of the American chamber music world, has been renovating its sound in recent years. When the group's original cellist, David Soyer, retired in 2001, the remaining players -- the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley and the violist Michael Tree --- brought in the cellist Peter Wiley, who, though considerably younger, had a broad range of chamber music experience. Any personnel change in a chamber ensemble of long standing will inevitably have an effect on the group's energy, and so far the results have been promising. On Saturday, Guarneri players are also likely to draw some electricity from Peter Serkin, who joins the group for Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A. The program also includes Mozart's String Quartet in B flat (K. 589) and Frank Bridge's String Quartet No. 1. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $45. ALLAN KOZINN EMMA KIRKBY AND FRETWORK The recital series at the Frick Collection offers a broad range of repertory, but early music played on period instruments has long been one its strengths. Fretwork, an English viola da gamba quintet that has made some superb recordings, is presenting a program of works by English composers, among them Taverner, Dowland, Byrd, Gibbons, Wilbye and Purcell. All wrote magnificent consort works, but they also contributed some of the most magical music in the English vocal repertory. The soprano Emma Kirkby, whose recordings of Dowland and Purcell songs are incomparable, will join the group to offer a sampling. Sunday at 5, Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. Free, but tickets are required. KOZINN MAURIZIO POLLINI The Italian pianist Maurizio Pollini takes his music seriously, and he often takes it on the road. On Sunday he makes one of his regular calls at Carnegie Hall, and as usual his repertory rarely strays far from Chopin. The first half of this recital brings familiar favorites, including the Third Ballade and the B-flat minor Sonata. The 12 Preludes, Book II, of Debussy come after intermission: music whose seeming haze and indeterminacy hides a musical mind of great precision. Mr. Pollini's elegance and respect for texts should make the second half more interesting than the first. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $27 to $97. HOLLAND 'RUDDIGORE' For outlandish plot twists and clever complications, this 10th operetta in the Gilbert and Sullivan canon is not quite at the level of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' or ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Still, the most crucial Savoyard trademarks are there, from romantic mixups and light strains of social satire, to catchy chorus and inspired silliness. Albert Bergeret's New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, founded in 1974, has this repertory virtually to itself. Normally, Mr. Bergeret conducts the company's productions, but for this staged concert version, he will turn over the baton to Jan Holland, and will sing the role of Richard Dauntless. The cast also includes Del Bourree Bach, Richard Holmes, Stephen O'Brien, Megan Friar, Victoria Devany and Elizabeth Hillebrand. Sunday at 3 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $41 to $51. KOZINN RIVERSIDE CHURCH CARILLON In 1991, on a gorgeous summer Sunday, I went to review a recital on the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon at Riverside Church and -- amid the noise from boom-boxes, traffic and general neighborhood mayhem -- heard next to nothing. Now Milford Myhre, a renowned carillonneur, applies his hand (more properly, his fists) to the huge instrument, and he may have a fighting chance of being heard. This recital celebrates the reopening of the instrument after a five-year refurbishment, presumably including improvements in the church tower to give the sound surer direction and better projection toward street level. Sunday at 1 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6784. Free outdoor listening in the area. OESTREICH WARSAW PHILHARMONIC Town Hall used to be a hot spot for debuts, so it is somehow appropriate that Antoni Wit makes his New York debut as music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic there. On the other hand, what will a big international orchestra sound like in fairly intimate confines? Brahms's First Symphony should pack a wallop. The program also includes Krzysztof Penderecki's ''Polymorphia'' and Chopin's First Piano Concerto, with Olga Kern as soloist. Ms. Kern, a co-winner of the Van Cliburn competition in 2001, made a big impression at Zankel Hall in May: big enough that she was invited into Carnegie Hall soon after to substitute for an ailing Krystian Zimerman. Sunday at 3 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. Tickets: $15 to $35. OESTREICH NATHANIEL WEBSTER An impressive baritone voice, programming that's both intriguing and appealing and smart career-building: these are all nice attributes for a young singer to have, and Mr. Webster seems to have them. In his Carnegie Hall recital debut tonight, he offers songs with a wide range of folk and popular overtones, from Schumann settings of Robert Burns to Gershwin's ''Oh, Lady Be Good!'' The program also includes Purcell, Ravel, Wolf and a final set of rather disparate ''contemporary'' songs in English, from Bernstein to Rufus Wainwright to a single song from Ned Rorem's 9/11 cycle ''Aftermath,'' which Mr. Webster sang at its premiere and has kept in his repertory. His accompanist is Peter Murphy. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $32. MIDGETTE IAN BOSTRIDE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES Few song cycles are as wrenching and powerful as ''Winterreise,'' Schubert's bleak portrait of a lovelorn young man who leaves his town, on foot, on a winter's night. The texts, drawn from the final part of Wilhelm M\u00fcller's ''Poems From the Posthumous Papers of a Traveling Horn Player,'' capture the protagonist's changing emotional state, from disappointment and nostalgia to brief flowerings of self-deceived hopefulness, and back through multiple shades of despair. But it is Schubert's music -- both his shapely vocal lines and his evocative, almost pictorial piano writing -- that gives M\u00fcller's scenes their flesh and blood. Ian Bostridge (above right), a young English tenor, has established himself in recent years as an astute and sensitive lieder singer with a particular affinity for Schubert. Among his current projects is a series of Schubert recordings with the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, who proves a thoroughly sympathetic collaborator. The latest installment, as it happens, is a recording of ''Winterreise'' in which youthfulness and world-weariness are finely balanced. Given that Mr. Bostridge has generally proved even more affecting live than on disc, his concert version should not be missed. (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $25 to $84.) ALLAN KOZINN Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. BAX GRANT SHOWCASE PERFORMANCE The little engine that could of dance institutions, the Brooklyn Arts Exchange has encouraged some very good young modern-dance choreographers to spread their wings in free rehearsal sessions. The results will be seen in dances and performance pieces by Zina Camblin, Catherine Dill and Alyse Rothman this weekend and in programs in mid-November. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org. Tickets: $15. JENNIFER DUNNING COMPAGNIE 111 AND PHIL SOLTANOFF A French dance troupe from Toulouse and a New York director collaborate on ''Plan B,''a mixed-media production that sets dancers balancing and tilting on an ever-shifting topsy-turvy plane that they try to conquer with the aid of kung-fu fighting, bungee cords, Velcro suits and suction cups. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Victory Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30. JACK ANDERSON COMPANHIA PORTUGUESA DE BAILADO CONTEMPOR\u00c2NEO From Portugal, the Companhia will make its North American debut in the Martha Graham-trained Vasco Wellenkamp's ''Amaram\u00e1lia Abandono,'' an evocation of the Portuguese fado and Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues, one of the most famous interpreters of this style of folksong. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $38. DUNNING EVERETT DANCE THEATER In ''Home Movies,'' company members put their family histories onstage in a 75-minute production in which true stories are choreographically told, cut up, intertwined and connected in an attempt to comment on life in a multicultural world. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20. ANDERSON BIMBAVATI DEVI & COMPANY Ms. Devi, who teaches at the Manipuri Nartanalaya institution in India, is touring the United States with her dancers in lecture-performance programs on the devotional Manipuri style of Indian dance. Tomorrow at 4 p.m, Lotus Music and Dance Studios, 109 West 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 627-1076 ext. 16 or www.lotusarts.com. Tickets: $15; $12 students and 65+. DUNNING DURA MATER Kriota Willberg founded the company, whose name translates to ''tough mother,'' and her new ''The Bentfootes'' sounds as interestingly oddball. The piece tells the story of an American family of dancers from 1796 to today, incorporating recreations of period dances. It also asks the question: How could anyone be in the dance business for 200 years and not be famous? Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and 65+. DUNNING 'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85. DUNNING KITT JOHNSON Although Kitt Johnson heads a company called X-act in Copenhagen, this Danish choreographer has also achieved acclaim as a solo performer. In ''The Mirror'' she depicts an individual's quest to realize herself, and her complex solo journey toward self-perception takes place with the aid of mirrored reflections, some of which are only sporadically legible. Tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15. ANDERSON ISABEL GOTZKOWSKY AND FRIENDS Ms. Gotzkowsky's work has been described as theatrically assertive. Here, this German-born modern-dance choreographer presents dances that address public and private worlds as well as loss, memory and the stillness of isolation in a dance inspired by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In a third piece, four women interact with five set elements. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793 ext 11. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+ with identification. DUNNING HELLENIC FESTIVAL This ambitious festival focuses on the impact of ancient and classical Greek culture on contemporary thinking and art. The dance component begins this weekend with a performance by the Greek-American Folklore Society. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Bruno Walter Auditorium, New York Public Library of the Performing Arts, Lincoln Center, Manhattan, (212) 870-1630 or www.nypl.org. Free. DUNNING KOOSIL-JA In her new mixed-media ''deadmandancing Excess,'' the choreographer formerly known as Kumiko Kimoto examines the fear and fantasy of dying. The set includes dozens of television monitors and the media includes film, specifically footage from movie death scenes. It all sounds pretty grim, but this Bessie Award-winning choreographer often offers new perspectives on the great themes. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Thursday through next Saturday nights) at 9, Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 375-0186. Tickets: $15. DUNNING HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE Melissa Morrissey, Akua Parker, Sonny Robinson and Ramon Thielen, of Dance Theater of Harlem, are guest artists in a program featuring three premieres. Mr. Rubsam introduces dances on point into his repertory with ''Chorale,'' a work for three couples that features unusual partnering to an original score by Ricardo Llorca, and ''Django,'' a tribute to the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. ''Herman Sherman'' is a virtuosic solo by Shizu Yasuda set to Woody Herman's music. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 868-4444. Tickets: $22 and $30. ANDERSON * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15. DUNNING WHITE WAVE 2004 D.U.M.B.O. DANCE FESTIVAL More than 85 companies and choreographers and more than 350 dancers will perform in a series of marathons featuring work by new and newly familiar dance artists -- like Tina Croll, Tom Pearson, Sue Bernhard, Zvi Gotheiner and Young Soon Kim. We can't vouch for the general level of the choreography and performance, but if this festival is anything like the neighborhood it celebrates, the results should be yeasty. Tonight from 7 to 10; tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m., 5 to 7 p.m. and 8 to 10 p.m.; Sunday from 4 to 7 p.m, White Wave John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street at the waterfront, Brooklyn. There will also be an outdoor performance on Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, on the waterfront, between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, (718) 855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com. Free, but donations are encouraged. DUNNING Theater A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show. + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Broadway * 'AVENUE Q' (Tony Award winner for best musical, original score and book of a musical). The inspired brainchild of the songwriters Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, this canny toy chest of a musical takes its stylistic cues from ''Sesame Street,'' from its cheery urban set to its singing puppets of assorted colors and dispositions. And in doing so it becomes the first mainstream musical since ''Rent'' to coo with such seductive directness to theatergoers on the fair side of 40 in their own language, in which irony is less a mind-set than a loosely worn style. Directed by Jason Moore, with a book by Jeff Whitty, the show applies the coaxing, learning-is-fun attitude of children's educational television to the R-rated situations of postcollegiate life in the big city. Featuring a pitch-perfect ensemble of live performers and oversize hand puppets, ''Avenue Q'' is to ''Sesame Street'' what Mel Brooks's ''Producers'' is to vintage Broadway musicals: a connoisseur's tribute to what it only seems to send up (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $96.25, with a limited number of $21.25 rush tickets available by lottery at the theater at 5:30 p.m. for the evening show and at 11:30 a.m. for the matinee. BEN BRANTLEY + ''DRACULA, THE MUSICAL'' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25. BRANTLEY *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n\u00e9 Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives Among the play's resonant assertions is that lives themselves are narratives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show. BRUCE WEBER Off Broadway *+ 'GUANT\u00c1NAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire, like Tim Robbins's Bush-bashing ''Embedded'' (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. BRANTLEY * 'HEDDA GABLER' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65. CHARLES ISHERWOOD 'LAST EASTER' The unofficial anthem of Bryony Lavery's abrasively sentimental comedy is Irving Berlin's ''Easter Parade.'' But as you watch this tale of a terminally ill lighting designer and her terminally madcap friends, you may think of another Berlin standard, the one in which theater folk are hymned for being able ''to smile when they are low.'' The author, who made a smashing New York debut this year with ''Frozen,'' chronicles an antic trip to Lourdes undertaken by June (Veanne Cox), a lighting designer with second-stage cancer, and her three best friends. They all face down doom with the typically British stiff upper lip, though here it acquires a curl of flashy bravado. The attitude is adorned with bright, shrink-wrapped eccentricities and desperate jokes. Directed by Doug Hughes, the cast members are as winsomely brittle as the script demands that they be. But the pained, reflective lyricism at the play's center is overwhelmed by its brave, quippy flippancy (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theatre, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m.. Tickets: $60; $15 student rush tickets available 30 minutes before performances. BRANTLEY * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60. BRANTLEY 'RICHARD III' Ascending the throne has never been more of a struggle for Shakespeare's most Machiavellian monarch than it is in this production. Peter Dinklage (of the film ''The Station Agent''), who portrays the title character, is 4 foot 5 inches, and the throne of England was obviously designed with a taller man in mind. That means that for this Richard, physically placing himself in the seat of power requires strenuous and gymnastic exertions, an image that would be comic except for the determination and harsh sense of absurdity with which he invests it. And once this Richard is seated, he owns that throne. The hard blue ice of his eyes is enough to deflect any challenge. It is even almost enough to make you forget the overheated amateurishness of the show. Peter DuBois's production doesn't drag, but its high spirits are those of an overcaffeinated adolescent, all flailing limbs and whooping voice. See it, though, for Mr. Dinklage's refreshingly direct and purposeful Richard, whose fierce, effortful will power translates into extraordinary charisma (2:45). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at noon; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. ANITA GATES + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker magazine, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Last Chance 'THE BALD SOPRANO' AND 'THE LESSON' Works of art have a way of regaining currency as the years pass. The Romanian-born Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, writing in 1950, surely did not envision the 21st-century American political landscape, but his ''Bald Soprano,'' a dark comedy about the vacuity of language, seems eerily apposite today. This is true despite the flaws in Carl Forsman's production, which domesticates and slightly sentimentalizes Ionesco's corrosive vision, generating plenty of silly humor but failing to penetrate to the play's icy core. In ''The Lesson,'' the problem doesn't arise, since this more macabre comedy is clear-cut, at least in its emotional dynamics. It, too, could easily be seen by the politically minded as a grim cautionary tale for today. Beneath the play's preposterous comic surfaces, Ionesco makes unsettling connections between the corruption of means of communication and the unleashing of man's basest, most violent instincts; he seems to suggest that the destruction of language leads inexorably to the destruction of life. The new translations by Tina Howe are clever, crisp and generally similar to previous versions (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50. ISHERWOOD 'ROSE RAGE' This is not, as you might imagine, a comedy about dueling florists. It's a hefty slab of Shakespeare: all three parts of ''Henry VI,'' trimmed of fat and put through a meat grinder, then garnished with generous doses of directorial panache. A freshly sharpened cleaver is the weapon of choice in Edward Hall's flashy, eminently accessible production, which presents 15th-century England as a slaughterhouse doing big business. The three plays are compressed into less than four hours of stage time. (With a generous dinner break and two intermissions, ''Rose Rage'' requires about five and a half hours.) The overriding metaphor, equating war with butchery, is manifested in various arresting ways. A cleaver snaps down on a jiggling pile of organ meat, signifying the fated end of an earl. Globs of flesh drip from plastic bags flung up on meat hooks. Red cabbages, symbolizing traitorous heads, are splintered beneath wooden clubs. But metaphors are by their nature limiting, and Mr. Hall's has worn a bit thin by the end of the long evening. More problematic: Characters emerge only in broad outline here, and a real sense of humanity is largely missing from the production (5:30). The Duke on 42nd Street Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tonight and tomorrow night at 6; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $75. ISHERWOOD KRISTIN LINKLATER ''Hecuba'' seems to be this season's Greek tragedy of choice, on both sides of the Atlantic. This fall London is host to not one but two productions of Euripides' tragedy, with Clare Higgins (''Vincent in Brixton'') and Vanessa Redgrave playing the role of the captive Trojan queen. Here, in a production running through Oct. 30 at 45 Bleecker Street Theater, the role has been undertaken by Kristin Linklater (above foreground). Ms. Linklater's name may not have the box-office ring of a Redgrave, but she's an immensely revered figure in the acting community, renowned for her voice coaching. The author of the book ''Freeing the Natural Voice,'' she's currently the head of acting at Columbia University's theater department. The list of boldface-worthy actors she's worked with includes Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Bernadette Peters and Alfre Woodard. But even a natural voice as studiously freed as Ms. Linklater's presumably has been might be challenged by the role of Hecuba. She begins the play in despair, a prisoner of the Greeks in the aftermath of the Trojan War. Her anguish turns to rage when her daughter Polyxena is led off to be sacrificed by Odysseus. But wait, there's more! Before the play's conclusion Hecuba will also see the body of a son brought before her, setting the stage for a sanguinary finale. Even Ms. Linklater may want to keep a bag of throat lozenges handy. (This weekend's schedule: tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 7 p.m., 45 Below, at 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. Tickets: $15.) CHARLES ISHERWOOD Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums 'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3. KEN JOHNSON * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE'' AND ''NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Oct. 30. An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tirol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. A show within a show of 40 residences by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. SMITH * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely rivetting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel short-changed. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. HOLLAND COTTER * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantels worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. By default the show reminds us that design is a pressing social issue, which makes it slightly revolting to see successful artists indulge themselves at society's expense. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH 'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here where short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, are on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+. GRACE GLUECK 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting some 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how his likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show with its catalog is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on first Saturday of every month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3. GLUECK * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan), (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly publication in 1972, Life was the country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show reminds of many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the war in Vietnam. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of the era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. SMITH Galleries: Uptown * BEN NICHOLSON, Jacobson Howard, 19 East 76th Street, (212) 570-2362, through Oct. 23. The best pieces in this show of paintings and drawings by one of the best painters to emerge in England between the world wars are a half-dozen Cubist-style pictures from the 1940's and 50's. They are notable for their exquisite draftsmanship, suave colors, delicately tactile surfaces and lively, syncopated play with flat shapes and planar layering. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through Oct. 30. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices. GLUECK PETER GREAVES, ''Reverie,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Oct. 23. Mr. Greaves's miniature portraits of attractive young women, each a bit larger than a postage stamp, are marvels of fastidious technique. With a slightly hazy focus and not a single visible stroke of pencil or brush, his tiny, pensive heads seem to emerge as if conjured by sorcery from the dark backgrounds. JOHNSON PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, ''In Fluent Form,'' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, through Oct. 23. The stylized parsings of the body in these impeccably mannered canvases are accomplished by dividing flat, pristine white grounds with arrangements of thin vertical and horizaontal lines, often rooted in rounded blocks of brilliant color. The lines support bright, fleshy blobs in candy hues and occasionally end in hearts that flower into symmetrical bursts of wiry, wiglike curls. Elegant splatters of drops in the shape of eyeballs dance cheerily around these conceits. The high-finish paint surface is nothing short of perfection. The body as an 18th-century drawing room or a Vivaldi composition might work as a description of these pretty but sterile paintings. GLUECK Galleries: SoHo 'COVER GIRL: THE FEMALE BODY AND ISLAM IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Oct. 23. Islam is a monolithic word in the West, though there is every reason to know it shouldn't be. The five women in this show were born in Islamic countries or raised in Islamic households. Yet no two of them take the same approach to the theme -- at once a stereotype and a reality -- of the veiled female body in Islamic culture. A wall text by the Indian artist Rummana Hussain, who died in 1999, captures the prevailing refusal to deal in easy answers: ''Have you defined her? Does she have any options? Are her beliefs an escape? Or a security? Or a habit? Or a choice?'' The complete text is quite long, and it is composed entirely of questions. COTTER * 'LEON FERRARI: POLITISCRIPTS,' The Drawing Room, 35 Wooster St., (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 23. Born in Argentina in 1920, Leon Ferrari is one of a group of Latin American modernists who, in the 1960's, created an intensely politicized art that ran in parallel to, and sometimes anticipated, trends in Europe and North America. The ink-on-paper pieces in this small show may best be understood as a response to the repressive political of environment of Argentina in 1960's, when censorship was common. A few are inflammatory statements by the artist written in a twisting script at once amusingly ornate and next to impossible to read. And even those that look entirely abstract are executed with care, so that they all convey the impression of carrying coded and encrypted information known only to the artist. In short, they are like taunting gestures of counter-censorship. Through its very opaqueness abstraction becomes a political tool. COTTER ROBIN HILL, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012, through Oct. 23. Second-generation Process artists don't fade away, they just keep marshalling orderly accumulations of this or that material as if Eva Hesse never existed. The works here employ cotton batting, wax, plaster and string, as well as hundreds of tiny circles of mica that are pinned to the wall in buoyant circling lines. Beautiful, but also familiar. SMITH * DONALD JUDD, Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through Oct. 23. This show features an unknown work: the only triangular piece in captivity by the generally four-square Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd. It is large, equilateral, made of raw plywood mad open at the top, with its interior and exterior unexpectedly opposed. The only other triangular Judd is an outdoor work in concrete in Australia. SMITH 'TALESPINNING: SELECTIONS FALL 2004,' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 23. The work of 14 artists whose imagery flirts with narrative in one way or another fills this wide-ranging show, which exposes some intriguing talents. Some manipulate texts and even whole books; others play with fairy tales and folklore; still others base figments on literary characters and a few address social, political and other worldly topics. It all adds up to an uneven show, but one in the center's tradition of invigorating experiment. GLUECK Galleries: Chelsea AN-MY LE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Oct. 23. ''Theater of war'' refers to the geopolitical area that any war actively encompasses. But battles are staged and choreographed, troops deployed in units, like corps de ballet. All of this requires rehearsal, and rehearsal for war is the subject of these photographs, shot at the Marine Corps Air Ground Control Center in California, a desert outpost where marines train for future combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terrain has a John Ford-ish grandeur. The marines act out cowboy-and-Indian roles: some play Americans; others play Iraqis. The pictures are dramatic and gorgeous, as combat photography often is. They are also apt documents of a war which, some people argue, is based on a fiction and, at least as originally scripted, staged for the media. COTTER * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Oct. 23. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power. COTTER * PIPILOTTI RIST, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Oct. 23. This relatively uncluttered video installation offers full-blown Rist World along with further proof that the artist's dizzying, slipping, sliding conflation of sound, color, scale and spatial illusion has few equals in video. The subversive (feminist) tensions of Ms. Rist's best works are absent here, but the work makes the brain so fuzzily relaxed you may not notice. SMITH Other Galleries 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses. SMITH TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, ''Single Wide,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Oct. 22. ''Single Wide'' is a technically sophisticated, six-minute video loop that revolves around the nighttime event of a distraught woman crashing her pickup truck into her rural ''single wide''-size trailer home. Shot in one long circulating pan, it is like a film version of a Gregory Crewdson photograph with the vividly amplified sound effects of a Janet Cardiff production. JOHNSON Last Chance STEPHEN ANDREWS/JERRY MORIARTY, Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-3583, through tomorrow. Mr. Moriarty paints poignant autobiographical fantasies in a brusquely simplified realistic style. Voyeurism, women's underwear, leaking body fluids and a beloved dog named Fella are among his subjects; the paintings have the mundane, sometimes comically embarrassing weirdness of dreams. Mr. Andrews translates images of events in Iraq into soft-focus crayon drawings. JOHNSON HERNAN BAS, ''Sometimes With One I Love,'' Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, through tomorrow. Mr. Bas, who lives in Miami and was in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, paints formally modest but unabashedly sentimental narratives of adventure, sexual intrigue and mystical experience starring slender, fine-featured adolescent boys. Made in an expressionistic style that calls to mind paperback book covers of the 1940's, his easel-size paintings are exciting mainly for the possibly more ambitious future of painterly story-telling they promise. JOHNSON KRISTIN CALABRESE: EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER, Leo Koenig Inc., 249 Centre Street, SoHo (212) 334-9255, through tomorrow. The large paintings in this New York debut espouse an unlikely combination of Photo Realism, Process Art and political critique. Every image has been made or arranged by the artist and then painted, whether it is a mound of her students playing dead (''The Price of Oil'') or a tangle of colored tape (''Oh What a Tangled Web We Weave''). Clever, well-made and brightly colored, they offer cheerful protest in an uncheerful time. SMITH * ON KAWARA, ''Paintings of 40 Years,'' David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea,(212) 727-2070, through tomorrow. Along with the Rackstraw Downes show at Betty Cunningham and Giorgio Morandi at Lucas Schoormans, this radiant mini-survey ranks among the three most beautiful shows of painting in Chelsea right now. It is certainly the best chance to be won over by the seemingly relentless monochromatic date paintings that the artist has been making since 1966. They turn out to be remakrably varied, and almost perfect in their balance of mind and matter -- also known as the Conceptual and the Minimal. SMITH ROY LICHTENSTEIN, City Hall, City Hall Park and the Tweed Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, through today. Rising five stories under the octagonal skylight of the Tweed Courthouse's fabulous Italianate rotunda, Lichtenstein's clunky tower of giant cartoon brush strokes is an impressive sight, the centerpiece of a Public Art Fund installation of four sculptures in and around City Hall. Its sly commentary on Modernist myths of freedom and spontaneity is enhanced by its insertion at the core of New York City's bureaucratic control center. You can't just spontaneously walk in to see it, though. You can call 311 to sign up for a Friday-only tour. JOHNSON 'NO RETURN,' Momenta Art, 72 Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through Monday. Circulation -- of wealth, information, organic matter -- is the theme this shrewd group show. Where some artists make money from art, Jed Ela makes art from money. He weaves baskets from $1 bills, then sells them for the dollar amounts used. Peggy Diggs stamps dollar bills with conscience-probing one-line questions. The Conceptual artist Rainer Ganahl mails postcards using handmade stamps with politically loaded inscriptions. Rutherford Chang scrambles words and images from The New York Times into abstraction. Pawel Wojtasik's short film ''Dark Sun Squeeze'' documents the workings of a sewage treatment; filtered through technology and art, excrement gleams and shines. COTTER 'PAINTING WITH WORDS,' Koichi Yanagi Oriental Fine Arts, 58A East 66th St., (212) 744-5577, through Sunday. Koichi Yanagi's gallery is small; so are his exhibitions, even when their themes are spacious, as is the case in this bouquet of literary images. Handwritten poems trickle down sheets of paper that glint with powdered mica. A 17th century lacquer writing box alludes to the classic ''Tales of Ise,'' The centerpiece, a six panel screen attributed to Kano Takanobu (1571-1618), has a scene from ''The Tale of Genji'' will end in an amorous pursuit, though its hard to imagine any passion discomposing this courtly universe of 14-carat clouds, roofless rooms and origami-crisp gowns. COTTER THOMAS SCHEIBITZ, ''Brot & Spiele,'' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea,(212) 414-4144, through tomorrow. Mr. Scheibitz, who will represent Germany at the 2005 Venice Bienale, absorbs all kinds of sources -- from centuries-old maps to contemporary bar graphs -- into semi-abstract, semiotically suggestive paintings and constructions. What his allusive works mean is hard to say, but with their sharp edges and strident colors, they offer an interesting mix of raw clunkiness and stylish retro-modernism. JOHNSON 'SEMI-LUCID,' White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Sunday. Lauren Ross, who recently resigned as director and chief curator of White Columns, has organized an engaging show about a prevalent tendency in contemporary art: the reshuffling of familiar graphic conventions into pictures that are teasingly illusory yet indecipherably abstract. Aaron Noble's muscular wall paintings and Robert Medvedz's compressive ink drawings recycle comic book graphics; Jiha Moon mixes Eastern and Western sources with a delicate touch; and Julian Pozzi draws spacey configurations of finely hatched boxes inspired by patio furniture. JOHNSON WOLFGANG STAEHLE, ''2004,'' Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through tomorrow. An entrancing paradox animates Mr. Staehle's real-time video projections. Mural-scale images in the darkened main gallery show a view of Manhattan and a bucolic upstate view of the Hudson River, delivered by on-site cameras. A third, on a laptop screen, shows the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Nothing could be more artificial, yet as you study the slight changes that happen with each 10-second digital update, you feel as if you are truly in the spiritually uplifting presence of nature. JOHNSON 'SQUINT,' Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 782-0183, through Sunday. This aptly titled group show challenges the eye with effects both minuscule and manic. In the latter category is Deborah Sperber's actual-size replica of Jackson Pollock's ''Autumn Rhythm,'' accomplished with 165,000 pipe cleaners. As for tiny, there is Mark Shetabi's peephole version of Mary Boone's SoHo gallery. The thrills are mostly cheap, but they're still thrills. SMITH DAVID WOJNAROWICZ We don't have artists like David Wojnarowicz these days. Or if we do, they're lurking out there around the edges of the mainstream art world, which is pretty much where Wojnarowicz stayed before he died of AIDS in his 30's in 1992. He came to New York as a runaway kid, worked as a street hustler and settled on the Lower East Side, where he wrote voluminously and made art. He shot a series of photographs, ''Rimbaud in New York,'' between 1978 and 1979, when the city was on the skids. Each picture shows a man wearing a cut-out mask of the face of the precocious French poet Arthur Rimbaud, taken when he was in his teens. The man in Wojnarowicz's photos -- or men; it's uncertain whether he posed for all of them or asked others to as well -- appears in Times Square and Coney Island, in subways and on the abandoned West Side piers known as trysting places for gay sex. He smokes, shoots-up, masturbates or just stares; in two pictures he brandishes a gun. These are romantic images, and political images. They're young, lonely, erotic, cast-a-cold-eye tough. They're about disaffection, and about intense, hard-wired attachment, deep love and deep anger mixed. The gallery is also displaying pages from Wojnarowicz's notebooks; he was at least as good a writer as he was an artist, and maybe better. We sure could use his likes again. (Roth Horowitz, 160A East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 717-9067, through Oct. 30. Another show, ''Out of Silence: Artwork With Original Text,'' by Wojnarowicz appears at P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1044, through Nov. 13. Both are free.)

Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her long-time director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A. O. SCOTT 'A DIRTY SHAME' Starring Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville. Written and directed by John Waters (NC-17, 89 minutes). A crashing bore is more like it. Mr. Waters's latest movie once again pits unruly, life-affirming sex maniacs against uptight prudes. The line between them is blurry: the heroine, Sylvia Stickles (Ms. Ullman), starts out as a repressed suburban mother and, after suffering a concussion, goes on a libidinous rampage. She joins a sex-addict cult (led by Mr. Knoxville), which is devoted to discovering a hitherto undreamed-of kink that will unlock the erotic secrets of the universe. The movie sounds like more fun than it is, but Mr. Waters, after more than 35 years of moviemaking, remains a determined amateur. If his jokes were still funny, or his attitudes still provocative, the crudeness of the picture would be less bothersome, but the net effect of all the energetic naughtiness is like that of being in a room full of 8-year-old boys who have just learned some new swear words. SCOTT 'THE FORGOTTEN' Starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise. Directed by Joseph Ruben (PG-13, 100 minutes). In this preposterous thriller, a pseudo-spiritual, mumbo-jumbo, sciencefiction-inflected mess, Mr. Ruben does not just fail to tap into the talent of his luminous star, Ms. Moore; he barely gets her attention. As Telly, a Brooklyn mother in mourning, Ms. Moore delivers a performance that has all the emotional commitment of a bored kid playing with a light switch. Even after Telly discovers that all the images of her dead son have been erased from the photographs scattered around her home, Ms. Moore keeps flipping the switch: sad, not sad; sad, not sad. Initially, the disappearing images are explained away by Telly's creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Mr. Sinise), who insists that the boy never existed and that after suffering a miscarriage, she invented him out of thin air. Telly finds this hard to believe (she isn't the only one) and embarks on a Search for the Truth involving cheap thrills, emotional uplift and some nonsense about the eternal mother. MANOHLA DARGIS 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganze in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback. SCOTT * 'I (heart) HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope. DARGIS 'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism. DARGIS * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'RAISE YOUR VOICE' Starring Hilary Duff. Directed by Sean McNamara (PG, 97 minutes). Ms. Duff, as Terri Fletcher, redefines the word ''pep.'' But when tragedy strikes her family, Terri loses her voice (her great joy is singing) and her love of life. The only thing that might snap her out of it would be attending a very hard to get into summer-music program in Los Angeles, but her hardheaded father (David Keith) objects. It takes deception and the help of a free-spirited aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) to get her there. Predictably, the big city lives up to its bad reputation at first, but chances are good that Terri will find her voice again, teach her parents a lesson and get the guy (Oliver James). Thinking adults won't find much of ''Raise Your Voice'' worth their time, but this piece of fluff's infectious high spirits will appeal to young moviegoers without conveying any sinister messages, beyond the suggestion that soul-crushing grief can be ''cured'' in the short space of a summer. ANITA GATES 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' STEPHEN HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT 'SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW' Starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. Written and directed by Kerry Conran (PG, 107 minutes). In this movie's elegant murk, Mr. Law and Ms. Paltrow slip into comic-book archetypes of the dashing aviator and the intrepid girl reporter with supreme confidence. When Mr. Conran's remarkable filmmaking debut remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, the movie charms as well as impresses. If nothing else, it is a landmark of computer-generated images, with actors cavorting through an entirely synthetic, retro-styled future world that fuses Art Deco, Futurism, Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis'' and the spirit of the 1939 World's Fair into an all-purpose eve-of-World War II environment extrapolated into a science-fiction limbo. But its visual elegance comes at a price. Its ethereal evocation of a pulp-fiction future-past eclipses almost any other sci-fi franchise in subtlety and imagination, but shadowy washed-out color is a far cry from the robust hues of a movie like ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' HOLDEN 'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women. SCOTT * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism. SCOTT * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and popconcerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent rock and pop performances: nytimes.com/music. * AGAINST ME!/BLOOD BROTHERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. An appealing double-bill starring two different bands of punk-rock eccentrics. Against Me!, from Gainesville, Fla., specializes in roaring, galloping folk songs. And the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, compose screaming (but sly) tantrums; their new album is ''Crimes'' (V2), which includes a jagged, wriggly ballad called, ''Peacock's Skeleton With Crooked Feathers''; for maximum enjoyment, bring a lyric sheet to the show and follow along. Tonight at 8, with True North; tickets are $12. KELEFA SANNEH BROTHERS PAST, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A jam band that leans toward jazz-rock, the Brothers Past thrive on odd meters and sudden shifts from vamp to vamp. Tomorrow night at 11:30; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow. JON PARELES * DANU, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Danu is an Irish traditional band that plays old-fashioned acoustic instruments, with a repertory that reaches from fierce fiddle reels to pensive ballads. Its arrangements show an ear for texture that allows for both drive and delicacy. Tonight at 7:30; admission is $18. PARELES * DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. This indie-rock band was responsible for one of 2003's best albums, ''Translatanticism'' (Barsuk), which contained 11 impeccable songs about lovers just out of reach. The guitarist and producer Chris Walla stripped the music down so you could hear every hum and sigh, and Ben Gibbard peeled back layers as he sang, often starting with a vivid metaphor and ending with a memorable plea. The live show is a bit louder and messier than the pristine album -- Mr. Gibbard doesn't miss a beat, but he does sometimes miss the microphone. Expect him to sound lovely, regardless. Tonight at 6:45, with Pretty Girls Make Graves; tickets are $21 in advance, $24 tonight. SANNEH ELYSIAN FIELDS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. Tonight at midnight; admission is $5. PARELES VICENTE FERNANDEZ, Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs, which bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $54.50 to $139.50. PARELES GALACTIC, Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 502-0600 and Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Galactic carries on the second-line groove tradition of its hometown, New Orleans, with easy-rolling funk tunes that add a horn section to the syncopated subtleties of the Meters. At the Stone Pony tonight at 8; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 at the door. At Irving Plaza tomorrow night at 8, with Scratch (formerly of the Roots) opening, and Sunday night at 8 with Mike Doughty and JJ Grey opening; tickets are $25. PARELES * AL GREEN,Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800, and Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together' sound like aching, immediate pleas, and sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does, but he's never less than charismatic. Stephanie Mills, who moved between Broadway (''The Wiz'') and pop-soul hits in the 1970's and 80's, opens at Westbury. But at the Beacon, Mr. Green is paired with another great gospel-steeped singer: Mavis Staples, whose husky voice holds both reverence and earthly sensuality. Her current album, ''Have a Little Faith'' (Alligator), is her first in a decade, and it shows she has held on to every bit of her sultry fervor. At Westbury tonight at 8; tickets are $56.50. At the Beacon tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 to $85. PARELES * JUNIOR BOYS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; Other Music, 15 East 4th Street, East Village, (212) 477-8150. Domino Records just reissued this Canadian group's suave debut album, ''Last Exit,'' which synthesizes different iterations of electonica: dubby microhouse, old-fashioned new wave, futuristic R & B. On the title track, Jeremy Greenspan sighs woe-is-us lyrics over rippling, hiccupping rhythms. And during the last song, ''When I'm Not Around,'' as a saxophone materializes, unexpectedly but gently, to nudge the CD toward its conclusion. Tomorrow night at the Bowery Ballroom at 10, opening for the appealing local guitar-tronica duo Ratatat and the fiddly German electro-pop act Mouse on Mars; tickets are $14. Sunday evening at Other Music at 7; admission is free. SANNEH * KANDA BONGO MAN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Kanda Bongo Man is one of the suavest singers in Congolese pop, where suavity is king. He helped turn the lilting guitar rumbas of soukous into the even more upbeat style called kwassa kwassa, crooning over a skein of luminous guitars. Tomorrow night at midnight; admission is $25. PARELES THE LAST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOYS/MAIN SQUEEZE ORCHESTRA, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Accordions and more accordions are on the bill as the Last of the International Playboys, a loungey, eclectic nine-piece band led by Walter Kuehr on accordion and bassoon, is reinforced by his other project: the 18-woman, 18-accordion Main Squeeze Orchestra, which he conducts. It's Mr. Kuehr's birthday. Tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow. PARELES * LITTLE BRAZIL, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. A band led by Landon Hedges, an Omaha singer-songwriter who has spent time with both Desaparecidos and the Good Life. Mr. Hedges has a skewed, boyish warble, which pulls his sweet and tuneful indie-rock songs slightly askew; ''Now,'' from the group's forthcoming debut album (on the Seattle-based Mt. Fuji Records), has a simple chord progression, a swaying 6/8 beat and lots of sighing-then-screaming mood changes; by the time you're finished figuring out whether you like it, the song's already over -- and, more likely than not, already stuck in your head. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $8. SANNEH * LYLE LOVETT/JOHN HIATT/JOE ELY/GUY CLARK, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Three Texans and a ringer from Indiana share this bill of smart, down-home songwriters. Lyle Lovett uses the ache in his voice to sound utterly heartfelt even when his songs grow wry and absurd, while his limber band covers the Texas spectrum from swing to honky-tonk to gospel. John Hiatt, who was born in Indianapolis, sings about loyalty, love and the full range of human eccentricity with his deep-diving baritone and unlikely rhymes. Joe Ely's songs encompass a West Texas of cowboys and cockfights, honky-tonks and wide-open spaces, country and rockabilly and rhythm-and-blues, and Guy Clark writes cozy, aphoristic songs about the pleasures of friendship, romance and home-grown tomatoes. Tonight at 8; tickets are $38.50 to $78.50. PARELES * PHIL ROY, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The first words on Phil Roy's most recent album, ''Issues + Options'' (Or Music) are, ''I've got a feeling something's wrong.'' An undercurrent of raw melancholy runs through his songs, making him a kindred spirit to brooding types like Leonard Cohen, John Martyn and Peter Gabriel. He often sings in a thoughtful tenor with a backup of folky guitars, and occasionally he rasps like a haggard rocker, but he's always full of clear-eyed compassion. Tomorrow night at 7:30; admission is $15. PARELES ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local D.J. and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a ''Grammy-winning D.J.,'' although that title seems like faint praise. This past August he issued ''Release Yourself Vol. 3'' (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, ''The Love You Bring Me.'' Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, more at the door. SANNEH THE SECTION QUARTET, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The Section Quartet is a string quartet that plays rock events like the Coachella Festival; for this show, it's performing its transcriptions of Radiohead's album 'OK Computer.' Tonight at 11; admission is $10. PARELES GENO SITSON, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-6900. Geno Sitson, a New Yorker from Cameroon, sings modal songs that repatriate African-influenced jazz. Also, using his body for percussion, he performs vocal solos that evoke all sorts of voices, instruments and natural sounds, as if Bobby McFerrin had a brother steeped in African polyphony. Tomorrow at 2; admission is free, but reservations are required. PARELES TOWER OF POWER, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Times Square, (212) 997-4144. A funk band from Oakland, Calif., that's renowned for the punch of its horn section, Tower of Power has persevered since the 1970's, concentrating less on songs (though it had moderate hits with ''So Very Hard to Go'' and ''Don't Change Horses'' in the early 1970's) than on a danceable groove. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $25.50 in advance, $30 the day of the show. PARELES YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Yonder Mountain String Band, from Colorado, carries a traditionalist bluegrass lineup -- banjo, guitar, mandolin and bass, with high vocal harmonies and no drums -- onto the jam-band circuit, picking its way through songs of wanderlust and thwarted love. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22 in advance, $25 at the door. PARELES YOSHIDA BROTHERS/AKIRA SATAKE, Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The shamisen is a Japanese stringed instrument with a bright, snapping attack that can sound a lot like a banjo to American ears, and music from Tsugaru, in northern Japan, bounces along like bluegrass. The Yoshida Brothers build modern tunes, with touches of rock and jazz, on a foundation of traditional shamisen music. To test the bluegrass connection, Akira Satake, a banjo player, opens the concert picking Appalachian tunes. Tomorrow at 3 and 8; tickets are $25, $21 for World Music Institute members. PARELES Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/music. ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. A young tenor saxophonist with a beautiful sound, centering in the Coltrane-ish lower-middle register; if he is a little unabashedly entranced by a particular area of jazz's past, around 1955 to 1965, he does well by it. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20. BEN RATLIFF JOHN BENITEZ QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. This Puerto Rican bassist has become one of the most valuable parts of the new Latin-jazz scene in New York; he has recently been seen leading a number of different bands, and this is yet another. It includes Luis Bonilla on trombone, Ivan Renta on bass, and Patrick Forero on drums. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF * DIZZY ALUMNI ALLSTARS, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. This has become an annual homage to Dizzy Gillespie during his birthday week. It's usually led by Jon Faddis, but this weekend the star is Clark Terry, one of the great soloists in jazz; other musicians this week include Roy Hargrove, James Moody, Slide Hampton, Benny Green and the singer Roberta Gambarini. Sets through Sunday are at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; cover charge is $35 at the tables, $20 at the bar and there is a $5 minimum. RATLIFF * DIZZY GILLESPIE FESTIVAL, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. Jazz at Lincoln Center's new nightclub is opening with two weeks celebrating Dizzy Gillespie. The first week centers on Gillespie's small-band music, including his great bop landmarks of the 40's, and it features Bill Charlap's trio, with the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson and the trumpeter Nicholas Payton as guests. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $35 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar. RATLIFF * JIM HALL/GEOFF KEEZER, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. A weekend of duos by the guitarist Jim Hall -- a patient, honest musician and a fascinating improviser -- with the pianist Geoff Keezer. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF * FRED HERSCH DUOS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. If the jazz pianist Fred Hersch is a superb solo performer, that encomium can stretch to his duo performances, in which he both accompanies and makes a lot of his own rapturous, harmony-rich, dynamically calibrated sound-world as well. It's the end of a week at the Jazz Standard -- reprising a successful experiment at the club last year -- in which a different duo partner is featured each night. Tonight Mr. Hersch performs with the bassist John Patitucci, tomorrow with the singer Nancy King and Sunday night with the tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF * DAVE HOLLAND QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. It's unmistakable when a band hits its stride, and the bassist Dave Holland's quintet arrived at that point in the late 90's. The music seems to play itself: dynamically controlled, light and built of sleek lines from the horns in front (Chris Potter on saxophones and Robin Eubanks on trombone), which come together and then fork off into elegant counterpoint. And it is settled by the leader's strong, thick bass lines, in vamps that repeat and repeat until it's time for solos that virtuosically make their case. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF ARTURO O'FARRILL, BAM Cafe, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Mr. O'Farrill, son of the composer and arranger Chico O'Farrill, came into his father's band through the piano chair and now, since the father's death, has become its boss; more recently he became leader of Lincoln Center's impressive new Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra. He is as conceptually invested in Afro-Cuban jazz as his father was, but in his own band he gets the jolt of the new by collaborating with the great younger players of the music. Tonight at 9:30; minimum is $10. RATLIFF * DIANNE REEVES AND FREDDY COLE, Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. Jazz singers these days seem more likely to find their information more in the restraint and mystery of bossa nova than in the unapologetic splendor of, say, Sarah Vaughan. Maybe it's because they feel that reticent music implies modernity more quickly. If so, Dianne Reeves is their opposite: she's only lightly concerned with reticence. She has an enormous (and Vaughan-inspired) voice, and an enormous talent, and she offers it up to stun her audience. Freddy Cole is the brother of Nat (King) Cole, but they sound more like cousins: though the quick-reflex delivery is there in the voice, Freddy has a richer, wider tone. He is one of the better ballad singers in jazz. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 to $150. RATLIFF * VISION CLUB: JOHN ZORN, ROB BROWN, ROY CAMPBELL, HENRY GRIMES, ET. AL., Brunstein Showroom, 13 Stanton Street between Chrystie and Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681. It's the first night of what will become a weekly occurrence: a group of musicians in New York's free-jazz community gathered together at this new Lower East Side spot to improvise together in varying formations. Tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $15. RATLIFF * STEVE WILSON QUARTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Steve Wilson, the saxophonist, has been in demand all over the jazz world since the 90's; everybody wants his light sound and his total assimilation of postwar saxophone history, from Parker to Coleman. He brings a band this weekend that includes the pianists Helen Sung (tonight) and Bruce Barth (tomorrow) as well as the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Adam Cruz. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. * KAREN AKERS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Akers brings back ''Time After Time,'' her acclaimed salute to the traditional love song. Demure and statuesque with an air of aristocratic reserve, she retains the formality of a concert performer while delivering beautifully intoned, deeply felt versions of standards that include ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' ''Falling in Love With Love.'' ''Time After Time,'' and ''Loving You.'' It is as romantically satisfying a cabaret show as you'll ever find. Don Rebic accompanies on piano. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, with a late show tomorrow night at 10:30. Cover $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. HOLDEN CY COLEMAN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. At 75, the Count Basie of cocktail jazz piano still commands the keyboard with the authority of a sharpshooter who never misses. He is served exceptionally well by the other members of his trio, the bassist Gary Haase and the drummer Buddy Williams. But his singing is shaky. The bulk of the show is an anecdote-laced retrospective of Mr. Coleman's show tunes sung by the composer in a gruff, frayed, occasionally tuneless voice. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows and $30 at the late shows. HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at one least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90. HOLDEN Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera often succeeds in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in the case of Verdi's ''Aida,'' originally conceived as grand opera. Everyone involved in the current revival can at least succeed in making the thing fly, led by Dolora Zajick as Amneris, whose ringing mezzo sometimes threatens to blow everyone else offstage, and Marcello Viotti in the pit, trying to keep the other principals in line. Fiorenza Cedolins is not up to the title role, except when she can sing quietly, but at least looks pretty; Franco Farina as Radam\u00e8s has a robust tenor but a hint of a buzz-saw quality in the upper register. Add a few armies of dancers and a couple of braces of horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215. ANNE MIDGETTE 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' It has been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Boh\u00e8me'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Anne Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric-soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi. The elegant soprano Ainhoa Arteta will be Musetta. The impassioned tenor Marcelo \u00c1lvarez sings Rodolfo, and the young Swedish baritone Peter Mattei, who was such a charismatic Don Giovanni last season, appears as Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200. ANTHONY TOMMASINI 'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty op\u00e9ra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival: Maria Domashenko takes on Carmen; Fabio Armiliato sings Don Jos\u00e9; Maureen O'Flynn is Mica\u00ebla; and the stentorian bass-baritone Louis Otey is Escamillo. An additional tenor will be present in the pit: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. MIDGETTE 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' This great collaboration between Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte has everything: comic scenes that demand clockwork pacing, spectacularly beautiful vocal and orchestral writing, a durable political undercurrent, thanks to the Beaumarchais play on which it is based, and most crucially, some truly moving lessons about love, betrayal and forgiveness. John Copley's lovely production has been in the New York City Opera repertory since 1977, but it has worn well, partly because the soft-hued sets and costumes by Carl Toms never get in the way of the music, and Albert Sherman's stage direction strikes a fine balance between solo turns and ensemble acting. The cast this season includes David Pittsinger as Figaro; Sharon Rostorf-Zamir as Susanna (in her house debut); Jennifer Rivera as Cherubino; Paulo Szot as the Count, and Orla Boylan as the Countess. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 tonight; $32 to $115 on Sunday. ALLAN KOZINN 'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. Since the start of this revival in September, she has been joined by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. Ari Pelto, a young conductor in his first appearances with the company, conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115. MIDGETTE Classical Music BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, the German cellist Peter Bruns and the pianist Christoph Berner complete their two-part survey of Beethoven's music for cello and piano, including the seldom-performed variations on a theme from Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' Tomorrow and Sunday, the violinist Mark Peskanov joins them for Beethoven's ''Ghost'' Trio and Schubert's magnificent B-flat major trio. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20. JEREMY EICHLER CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER In its further pursuit of the European tradition, the Chamber Music Society heads east this weekend. Dvorak, master of Czech nationalism and every music lover's friend, takes up two-thirds of the program. The beloved Opus 81 Piano Quintet is one item, the lesser-known Opus 77 String Quintet, the other. Alexander Tcherepnin, a Russian cosmopolitan and busy composer, led a musical life on the fringes of a 20th-century music establishment dominated by Stravinsky and others, but his Cello Sonata in D will get a rare chance at the beginning of this program. Edgar Meyer is the bassist and Anne-Marie McDermott the pianist in an ensemble of players all of whom will be familiar to Chamber Music Society fans. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48. BERNARD HOLLAND GEWANDHAUS ORCHESTRA OF LEIPZIG This orchestra, which traces its history to 1743, gave the world's first complete traversals of the Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner symphonies and lists Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Kurt Masur among its past music directors. Herbert Blomstedt, who became the orchestra's 18th director in 1998, is an insightful musician whose appproach should suit the all-Brahms programs he is leading on his current American tour with the orchestra. Yet concerts earlier this week at Avery Fisher Hall were puzzlingly inconsistent. Maybe it was an off night, or two. Now he heads across the Hudson to lead the Second Symphony and, with Garrick Ohlsson as his soloist, the First Piano Concerto. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $15 to $69. KOZINN GUARNERI STRING QUARTET This recital of works by Beethoven, Dohnanyi and Dvorak opens the 105th season of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, an important series that presents both young and established performers at remarkably affordable prices. As ensembles go, it doesn't get more established than the Guarneri Quartet, which was founded 40 years ago and still has three of its original members. The group also retains much of its trademark interpretative elegance in standard repertory, though when heard last weekend at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there were occasional lapses in tuning and ensemble control. One has to admire the group's storied past, but it also makes one wish for more joyfulness or passion in its music-making of the present. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 40 Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680. Tickets: $9. EICHLER CHRISTINA KISS The line between bravery and foolhardiness may be a thin one, and undertaking to perform the complete solo piano works of Liszt -- from memory -- in several dozen recitals might easily fall on either side. Christina Kiss, a pianist who was born in Budapest and has won prizes at several international competitions, undertook this project in 1990 and has so far made it through about 550 works, leaving enough to keep her busy, she estimates, through 2015 (a decade beyond her original projection). Ms. Kiss has not listed a program for her recital tomorrow but at this point, more than 30 installments into the series, it scarcely matters. More to the point, Ms. Kiss has the bravura technique and the imagination to make this mammoth project work, and if you're a Liszt fancier, this is clearly the place to be. Tomorrow afternoon at 2, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $35 to $45. KOZINN LUXEMBOURG PHILHARMONIC Bramwell Tovey, this orchestra's British music director, has begun to make headway in America, notably in a series of summertime concerts with the New York Philharmonic a few months ago. The orchestra is making its New York debut, but you can sample its wares beforehand in a new recording of works by Albert Roussel on the Timpani label. And the great added attraction is the percussionist Evelyn Glennie, playing vibraphone in a transcription of a Vivaldi concerto and marimba in the New York premiere of Bright Sheng's ''Colors of Crimson.'' Mr. Bramwell also leads the orchestra in Berlioz's ''Roman Carnival'' and Elgar's ''Enigma Variations.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $65. JAMES R. OESTREICH * 'MUSIC FOR NEW YORK NOW' Marathon performances take on their own momentum. At the 10-hour piano extravaganza inaugurating a new performance space at the Faust Harrison Pianos showroom on Sunday, that momentum may be the main connecting thread in a deliberately eclectic narrative. The music is by composers from Chopin to Cage, classical to jazz; the 20-odd performers include leading lights of the contemporary scene like Margaret Leng Tan and Kathleen Supov\u00e9; even the instruments are varied, with pianos described as ranging from ''rare vintage'' to contemporary. Conceived and curated by Jed Distler and Michael Harrison, both composers and pianists whose own works will be performed, the marathon is offered free of charge to the public, so that one's own comings and goings form the parameters of an individual's experience of the event. Sunday from noon to 10 p.m., Faust Harrison Pianos, 205 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 489-0666. MIDGETTE NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS A chamber chorus with the word virtuoso in its name might seem over-confident, but the New York Virtuoso Singers can claim truth in advertising. Founded in 1988 by Harold Rosenbaum, the ensemble has won consistent praise for its technically accomplished and authoritative performances of a wide-range of challenging 20th-century and contemporary music. Mr. Rosenbaum is not just an expert music director but a bracing programmer. On Sunday his ensemble offers a typically adventurous program titled ''American Gems,'' with works by Crumb, Tsontakis, Zaimont, Mayer, Pellegrini and Chuaqui. At 4 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920. Suggested donation: $10; $8 for students and 65+. TOMMASINI ORPHEUS On its good days, this famously conductorless ensemble can play with enough precision and character to make baton-wielding maestros seem superfluous. Naturally, it also helps when the group has a strong soloist to take the lead, as it will in this concert when the formidable pianist Garrick Ohlsson performs Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1. The ensemble is also expanding its repertory, performing two works this weekend for first time: Brahms's Haydn Variations and Sandor Veress's ''Transylvanian Dances.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $88. EICHLER PANOCHA QUARTET Or you could argue that the headliner here is the Hungarian-born pianist Andras Schiff, in the second of a run of three appearances. (The last is a solo recital next Thursday in the Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall.) Here Mr. Schiff joins the Prague-based Panocha Quartet in Dvorak's Opus 81 Quintet. But the more savory Czech spices, if not the meat of the program, comes in Janacek's two quartets, the ''Kreutzer Sonata'' and ''Intimate Letters,'' as performed by masters of the style. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $38 to $52. OESTREICH CHARLES ROSEN One of the great thinkers of the keyboard world, Charles Rosen is renowned for his insightful books and essays. But his performances are by no means bookish: as concerned as he is with the details of form and style, he presents the great composers as creatures of flesh and blood, animated by passions, desires, victories and disappointments. In the second installment of his three-part series, ''The Romantic Generation'' -- the title comes from one of his books -- Mr. Rosen is exploring the peculiar world of Robert Schumann, one of Romanticism's defining spirits. Included in his program are the ''Arabeske,'' the Intermezzo from ''Faschingsschwank aus Wien,'' the Fantasy in C (Op. 17) and the richly characterized ''Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., with a preconcert lecture at 1:30. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $30. KOZINN * TOKYO STRING QUARTET With Hitler's ascent, many composers and musicians were forced to flee Europe, and we are only now beginning to understand how the modernist project was transported and transformed in their flight. With this concert, the Tokyo String Quartet begins a promising series at the 92nd Street Y, exploring the music of three exiled composers: Zemlinksy, Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler. Works by the latter two make up the heart of this program, including Eisler's little-known but wonderful String Quartet, as well as ''Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht,'' Schoenberg's feverishly beautiful paean to the Viennese fin-de-si\u00e8cle. It's tempting to say the Tokyo players are watering down their conceit since the Schoenberg was not written in exile, and Haydn is also on the bill, but with music of this caliber performed by a top-tier ensemble, who would really complain? Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $35. EICHLER Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's autumn season, which continues through Nov. 7, features a rich assortment of one-act works ideally suited for a space in which dramatic details come into vivid focus. Among this weekend's highlights are two new works to be shown tonight: Trey McIntyre's ''Pretty Good Year,'' a group piece (repeated tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon), and Christopher Wheeldon's ''VIII,'' a ballet about Henry VIII with Angel Corella as the amorous monarch (to be repeated later in the season). And there are amorous duelings in Jiri Kylian's ''Petite Mort.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $35 to $80. (Related review, Page 3.) JACK ANDERSON ARTUS/COMPANY G\u00c1BOR GODA This leading Hungarian dance and theater company will perform ''Cain's Hat,'' which explores the biblical stories of Cain and Moses. Artus, founded and directed by G\u00e1bor Goda, is known for its mix of concept, acrobatic movement and visual effects. Here, the performers perch on poles, collide in mid-air and pile stones. (For this they slaved at the ballet barre?) Today at noon and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11. Tickets: $20; $16 for students; $10 for noon performance. JENNIFER DUNNING * MONICA BILL BARNES Ms. Barnes has the kind of humor -- not a snicker in sight -- that is in woefully short supply in dance these days. ''The Happy Dance (or what started out O.K.)'' sounds like a perfect example. In the tragicomic exploration of hopelessness, two twinlike characters become obsessed with a dreary, fast-paced jig that will not let go of them. Ms. Barnes describes it all as post-modern dance and musical theater with a Brechtian spin. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15. DUNNING IAN SPENCER BELL DANCE CIRCLE This weekend's wildcard program is the work of a man, Mr. Bell, who has defined his choreographic interest as being ''in the space above our heads and beyond our grasp.'' His new ''Looking at the Stars'' is set to the music of the Platters. ''Laundry'' will be danced to music by Arlo Guthrie. A reception follows each performance. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Williamsburg Arts neXus, 205 North Seventh Street, between Driggs and Roebling Streets, Brooklyn, (718) 599-7997. Tickets: $12. DUNNING AKIM FUNK BUDDHA How to resist an artist who taught himself to stand still without blinking, tell stories, rap, tap and perform Mongolian throat singing? Mr. Buddha, who was born in Syracuse and raised in Zimbabwe, describes his ''Up in the Air'' as cosmic cabaret. It also features belly dancing by Pure and music by Mr. Kite. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30. BRIC Studio, 57 Rockwell Place, between Fulton Street and DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882, x53. Tickets: $10; $8 for students. DUNNING * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This new documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, which Mr. Dennis co-founded. The film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters. Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 14) at 2 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5. DUNNING 'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85. DUNNING FOURTHDIMENSIONDANCETHEATER Performers from De La Guarda, Momix and Stomp will join Karen Fuhrman and Dustin Stephens in their new ''Hymenoptera: The Social Order,'' danced to music by John Oyzon and Eric Lee of Groove Collective. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m. John Ryan Theater at White Wave, 25 Jay Street, at John Street and the waterfront, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (917) 447-6285. Tickets: $16 to $25. DUNNING KDNY Strictly speaking, this program combines the work of the New York-based KDNY company and of KDHDC of Austin, Tex. They will perform, respectively, modern-dance works dances by Kathleen Dyer and Kathy Dunn Hamrick. Now you know. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street at Washington Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15; $10 for students, 65+ and dancers. DUNNING ALI KENNER Ms. Kenner, whose mentor is Phyllis Lamhut, takes on the mathematical notion of absolute value in her new eveninglong dance of the same name. Set to music by Morgan Packard, the piece is a series of vignettes exploring the inevitabilities of attraction and habit. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15. DUNNING * KOOSIL-JA In her new mixed-media ''deadmandancing EXCESS,'' the choreographer formerly known as Kumiko Kimoto examines the fear and fantasy of dying. The set includes dozens of television monitors and the media includes film, specifically clips from movie death scenes. It all sounds pretty grim, but the Bessie Award-winning choreographer often offers new perspectives on the great themes. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Thursday through next Saturday) at 9. Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 375-0186. Tickets: $15. DUNNING MANDANCE PROJECT Eliot Feld's new choreographic endeavor brings together five men (Damian Woetzel, Wu-Kang Chen, Nickemil Concepcion, Jason Jordan and Sean Suozzi) and one woman (Patricia Tuthill) in solos, duets and group works by Mr. Feld to music ranging from Bach to jug band tunes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42. ANDERSON * MERI\u00c1N SOTO DANCE & PERFORMANCE Ms. Soto's new ''M\u00e1quina del Tiempo'' (''Time Machine'') is a full-evening piece in three parts that explores popular dance and music forms as ''time machines,'' which reveal much about their eras. The multi-media piece draws on postmodern dance and improvisational salsa, hip-hop, swing and mambo. Tonight through Sunday (and Thursday through next Sunday) at 7:30 p.m. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25. DUNNING 'MOUNTAIN VIEW ESTATES' Kourtney Rutherford of Big Dance Theater fame has set a murder in a house being built onstage. It all takes place in a residential tract in the shadow of a brooding volcanic Mount Rainier in Washington State in this eveninglong theater and dance piece, which examines the violence that lurks beneath everyday surfaces. Tonight and tomorrow night (and next Friday and Saturday) at 8 and 10. DUMBO Stable, 16 Main Street at Water Street, Brooklyn, (212) 420-7252. Tickets: $15. DUNNING NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: BANGARRA Australia's Bangarra Dance Theater, which brings age-old Aboriginal traditions to contemporary choreographic life, returns to New York with ''Bush,'' a lush celebration of creation stories from the region known as Arnhem Land. Choreographic vignettes by Stephen Page and Frances Rings include rituals honoring female sexuality. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4129. Tickets: $20 to $45. ANDERSON ANN ROBIDEAUX AND ALEXANDRA SHILLING Ms. Robideaux and Ms. Shilling choreograph offbeat dance as well as teaching at the American Dance Festival. Their new ''Sun Shines Over the Yardarm'' sounds like a similar mix of tradition and the new. The new site-specific dance piece will be performed aboard the historic lightship Frying Pan, as an interactive tour that combines dance, history and sound. Tomorrow at 1, 2 and 3 p.m. The Frying Pan, Pier 63, 23rd Street and West Side Highway, Chelsea, (646) 321-9383. Tickets: $15 (by reservation, which is recommended); $20 day of show. DUNNING * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Willliamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15. DUNNING * WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: MASKED RITUALS OF KERALA, INDIA In these ancient masked rituals (theyyams), men in sumptuous jeweled costumes and headdresses are transformed into gods and goddesses, shifting consciousness on stage from the mundane to the divine. Martial arts figure in dances (vellattam) for warrior gods. Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536. Tickets: $30; $15, children.

Broadway + 'DRACULA, THE MUSICAL' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25. BEN BRANTLEY *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n\u00e9 Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show. BRUCE WEBER * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic houswife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end, you may feel like you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51-$79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure on stage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner na\u00eff of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101. BRANTLEY Off Broadway + 'DIRTY TRICKS' Distinguishing between blazing energy and plain old desperation isn't always easy. Look at Martha Mitchell, who as the wife of United States Attorney General John Mitchell teetered so spectacularly between high spirits and dementia during the Watergate era. Now in John Jeter's ''Dirty Tricks,'' the redoubtable Judith Ivey has taken on the woman whose eagerness to share secrets and fears with the American people helped bring down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Ms. Ivey, as always, has vitality and skill to spare. But these assets are deployed in a vain attempt to paper over the seams in a conspicuously piecemeal play. Like its compulsively chatty heroine, ''Dirty Tricks,'' directed by Margaret Whitton, is scattershot, hazy and, yes, desperate. Even with Ms. Ivey pouring on the cotillion-belle flirtiness and Southern discomfort, ''Dirty Tricks'' is nowhere near as entertaining or alarming as Mrs. Mitchell was at the height of her notoriety (1:30). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative-writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60. BRANTLEY + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 'SPATTER PATTERN (OR HOW I GOT THAT STORY)' Neal Bell's moody new play is a cautionary tale that proves the wisdom of avoiding one's neighbors. Edward Dunn (Peter Frechette), one of the dual protagonists, is a screenwriter still in shellshock over the death of his companion of more than two decades. Trying to jumpstart his stalled career, he moves into a pokey new studio apartment. His neighbor who turns out to be -- egad! -- a tabloid star, the Prof Who Offed the Co-ed, although the guilt of Marcus Tate (Darren Pettie) has yet to be proved. (He hasn't even been charged.) Edward, at emotional loose ends, strikes up a casual friendship with the celebrity next door. They are soon embroiled in a knotty psychological intimacy. Elements of Mr. Bell's murder-mystery plot suggest the playwright has logged more than a few ''Law & Order'' marathons in his television-watching diary. But the writing has a literate, high-toned shimmer that would probably bring out the red pencils from Dick Wolf's producers. Unfortunately the playwright is unable to meld these elements into a satisfying whole. The play rings hollow as an inquiry into gray areas of moral responsibility. And ''Spatter Pattern'' fizzles out more thoroughly as a thriller with an unexciting conclusion. But the director Michael Greif's stylish production drenches the writing in so much noir-ish atmosphere it takes a while to notice. Mr. Frechette's familiar, woozy-wistful stage persona is a good match for the emotionally dislocated Edward, and the opaque surfaces of Mr. Pettie's Marcus Tate keep us guessing (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $38 to $45. CHARLES ISHERWOOD + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. ANITA GATES ++ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Last Chance * 'HEDDA GABLER' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65. ISHERWOOD 'LAST EASTER' The unofficial anthem of Bryony Lavery's abrasively sentimental comedy is Irving Berlin's ''Easter Parade.'' But as you watch this tale of a terminally ill lighting designer and her terminally madcap friends, you may think of another Berlin standard, the one in which theater folk are hymned for being able ''to smile when they are low.'' The author, who made a smashing New York debut this year with ''Frozen,'' chronicles an antic trip to Lourdes undertaken by June (Veanne Cox), a lighting designer with second-stage cancer, and her three best friends. They all face down doom with the typically British stiff upper lip, though here it acquires a curl of flashy bravado. The attitude is adorned with bright, shrink-wrapped eccentricities and desperate jokes. Directed by Doug Hughes, the cast members are as winsomely brittle as the script demands that they be. But the pained, reflective lyricism at the play's center is overwhelmed by its brave, quippy flippancy (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.. Tickets: $60; $15 student rush tickets available 30 minutes before performances. BRANTLEY 'RICHARD III' Ascending the throne has never been more of a struggle for Shakespeare's most Machiavellian monarch than it is in this production. Peter Dinklage (of the film ''The Station Agent''), who portrays the title character, is 4 foot 5 inches, and the throne of England was obviously designed with a taller man in mind. That means that for this Richard, physically placing himself in the seat of power requires strenuous and gymnastic exertions, an image that would be comic except for the determination and harsh sense of absurdity with which he invests it. And once this Richard is seated, he owns that throne. The hard blue ice of his eyes is enough to deflect any challenge. It is even almost enough to make you forget the overheated amateurishness of the show. Peter DuBois's production doesn't drag, but its high spirits are those of an overcaffeinated adolescent. See it, though, for Mr. Dinklage's refreshingly direct and purposeful Richard, whose fierce, effortful will power translates into extraordinary charisma (2:45). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.;Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off-camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3. KEN JOHNSON * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE' AND 'NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Oct. 30. An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus, but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. A show within a show of 40 houses by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. SMITH * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry, and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. HOLLAND COTTER * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. COTTER * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantles worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH 'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here where short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, are on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+. GRACE GLUECK 'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 2. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these statuettes, from the 15th to the mid-18th centuries and assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students. GLUECK 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how his likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show with its catalog is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3. GLUECK * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly magazine in 1972, Life was this country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show is a reminder of many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism, package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. KIMMELMAN * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the Vietnam War. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of that era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH Galleries: Uptown NICOLA HICKS, Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, (212) 439-1700, through Oct. 30. This accomplished British sculptor combines neo-Classical traditionalism, surrealistic mythology and Modernist raw materialism in bronze and painted plaster representations of humans and animals. The life-size reclining nude attended by winged putti veers toward old school academicism, but the portraits of dogs and the muscular head of a Minotaur have much vitality. JOHNSON STONE ROBERTS, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through Oct. 30. Mr. Roberts aims for a kind of Victorian revivalism in his big paintings of well-to-do New Yorkers inside and outside their well-appointed homes. Apparently copied from photographs, they are made with assiduous attention to detail, and from a distance the realist illusionism is impressive if not colorful. The narrative psychology is vapid, however, and under close-up inspection, the paint is lifeless. JOHNSON FRITZ BULTMAN, ''Irascible II: Abstract Expressionist Paintings, Circa 1960,'' Schlesinger, 24 East 73rd Street, (212) 734-3600, through Oct. 30. In the late 1950's and early 60's, this Abstract Expressionist was in top form, judging by the eight small- to medium-size canvases in this show. He wasn't doing anything that Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline didn't do, but his impetuous, sensuously crusty paintings have an urgency of their own that still feels fresh. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through Oct. 30. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past, but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices. GLUECK Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Nov. 22. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON WILLIAM HUDDERS, Tatistcheff, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4547, through Oct. 30. If you gave this exhibition of neatly painted views of Long Island City-scapes and still-life pictures of shoes, apples and glassware just a quick glance you might peg it as the work of an earnestly conservative recent art school graduate. The more you look, however, the more inexplicably odd, sweet and subtly humorous these cannily simplified pictures seem. Influences of De Chirico and Hopper are evident, but Mr. Hudders has his own engaging way with the poetry of ordinary things. JOHNSON JEFF LADOUCEUR, ''Schmo,'' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through Nov. 13. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad-sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopi and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching. JOHNSON Galleries: Chelsea TONY DE LOS REYES, ''The Strange Tale of Near and Far,'' DCKT Contemporary, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-9955, through Oct. 30. From a distance it looks as if Mr. de los Reyes is in engaged in an eccentric revival of some antique tradition. He paints images of 17th-century ships at sea and detailed images of wild plants and flowers in shades of blue and white like Delftware. Up close you discover that these glossy pictures are made by distinctively modern methods of pouring, pooling and manipulating liquid paint. JOHNSON * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Oct. 30. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power. COTTER Other Galleries 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses. SMITH Last Chance HERNAN BAS, ''Sometimes With One I Love,'' Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, through tomorrow. Mr. Bas, who lives in Miami and was in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, paints formally modest but unabashedly sentimental narratives of adventure, sexual intrigue and mystical experience starring slender, fine-featured adolescent boys. Made in an expressionistic style that calls to mind paperback book covers of the 1940's, his easel-size paintings are exciting mainly for the possibly more ambitious future of painterly story-telling they promise. JOHNSON SANG-AH CHOI, ''Ultra Immortality,'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through tomorrow. A skillful technician and inventive Neo-Pop image maker, Ms. Choi produces glossy panel paintings that use resin and reflective plastics to imitate traditional Asian lacquer work. Images lifted from fashion magazines and childishly sweet cartoons seduce while satirizing a world of infantile consumerism. Also on view are small pop-up books that are marvels of paper-cutting craft. JOHNSON 'COVER GIRL: THE FEMALE BODY AND ISLAM IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1649, through tomorrow. Islam is a monolithic word in the West, though there is every reason to know it shouldn't be. The five women in this show were born in Islamic countries or raised in Islamic households. Yet no two of them take the same approach to the theme -- at once a stereotype and a reality -- of the veiled female body in Islamic culture. A wall text by the Indian artist Rummana Hussain, who died in 1999, captures the prevailing refusal to deal in easy answers: ''Have you defined her? Does she have any options? Are her beliefs an escape? Or a security? Or a habit? Or a choice?'' The complete text is quite long, and it is composed entirely of questions. HOLLAND COTTER * DONALD JUDD, Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, Soho, (212) 966-5154, through tomorrow. This show features an unknown work:the only triangular piece in captivity by the generally four-square Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd. It is large, equilateral, made of raw plywood mad open at the top, with its interior and exterior unexpectedly opposed. The only other triangular Judd is an outdoor work in concrete in Australia. SMITH * 'LEON FERRARI: POLITISCRIPTS,' The Drawing Room, 40 Wooster St., (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. Born in Argentina in 1920, Leon Ferrari is one of a group of Latin American modernists who, in the 1960's, created an intensely politicized art that ran in parallel to, and sometimes anticipated, trends in Europe and North America. The ink-on-paper pieces in this small show may best be understood as a response to the repressive political of environment of Argentina in 1960's, when censorship was common. A few are inflammatory statements by the artist written in a twisting script at once amusingly ornate and next to impossible to read. And even those that look entirely abstract are executed with care, so that they all convey the impression of carrying coded and encrypted information known only to the artist. In short, they are like taunting gestures of counter-censorship. Through its very opaqueness abstraction becomes a political tool. COTTER PETER GREAVES, ''Reverie,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through tomorrow. Mr. Greaves's miniature portraits of attractive young women, each a bit larger than a postage stamp, are marvels of fastidious technique. With a slightly hazy focus and not a single visible stroke of pencil or brush, his tiny, pensive heads seem to emerge as if conjured by sorcery from the dark backgrounds. JOHNSON ROBIN HILL, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-0012, through tomorrow. Second-generation Process artists don't fade away, they just keep marshalling orderly accumulations of this or that material as if Eva Hesse never existed. The works here employ cotton batting, wax, plaster and string, as well as hundreds of tiny circles of mica that are pinned to the wall in buoyant circling lines. Beautiful, but also familiar. SMITH TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, ''Single Wide,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through today. ''Single Wide'' is a technically sophisticated, six-minute video loop that revolves around the nighttime event of a distraught woman crashing her pickup truck into her rural ''single wide''-size trailer home. Shot in one long circulating pan, it is like a film version of a Gregory Crewdson photograph with the vividly amplified sound effects of a Janet Cardiff production. JOHNSON AN-MY LE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through tomorrow. ''Theater of war'' refers to the geopolitical area that any war actively encompasses. But battles are staged and choreographed, troops deployed in units, like corps de ballet. All of this requires rehearsal, and rehearsal for war is the subject of these photographs, shot at the Marine Corps Air Ground Control Center in California, a desert outpost where marines train for future combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terrain has a John Ford-ish grandeur. The marines act out cowboy-and-Indian roles: some play Americans; others play Iraqis. The pictures are dramatic and gorgeous, as combat photography often is. They are also apt documents of a war which, some people argue, is based on a fiction and, at least as originally scripted, staged for the media. COTTER * BEN NICHOLSON, Jacobson Howard, 19 East 76th Street, (212) 570-2362, through tomorrow. The best pieces in this show of paintings and drawings by one of the best painters to emerge in England between the world wars are a half-dozen Cubist-style pictures from the 1940's and 50's. They are notable for their exquisite draftsmanship, suave colors, delicately tactile surfaces and lively, syncopated play with flat shapes and planar layering. JOHNSON PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, ''In Fluent Form,'' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, through tomorrow. The stylized parsings of the body in these impeccably mannered canvases are accomplished by dividing flat, pristine white grounds with arrangements of thin vertical and horizontal lines, often rooted in rounded blocks of brilliant color. The lines support bright, fleshy blobs in candy hues and occasionally end in hearts that flower into symmetrical bursts of wiry, wiglike curls. Elegant splatters of drops in the shape of eyeballs dance cheerily around these conceits. The high-finish paint surface is nothing short of perfection. The body as an 18th-century drawing room or a Vivaldi composition might work as a description of these pretty but sterile paintings. GLUECK * PIPILOTTI RIST, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through tomorrow. This relatively uncluttered video installation offers full-blown Rist World along with further proof that the artist's dizzying, slipping, sliding conflation of sound, color, scale and spatial illusion has few equals in video. The subversive (feminist) tensions of Ms. Rist's best works are absent here, but the work makes the brain so fuzzily relaxed you may not notice. SMITH 'TALESPINNING: SELECTIONS FALL 2004,' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. The work of 14 artists whose imagery flirts with narrative in one way or another fills this wide-ranging show, which exposes some intriguing talents. Some manipulate texts and even whole books; others play with fairy tales and folklore; still others base figments on literary characters and a few address social, political and other worldly topics. It all adds up to an uneven show, but one in the center's tradition of invigorating experiment.

Broadway + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95. BEN BRANTLEY * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end, you may feel like you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51-$79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure on stage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner na\u00eff of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101. BRANTLEY Off Broadway + 'DIRTY TRICKS' Distinguishing between blazing energy and plain old desperation isn't always easy. Look at Martha Mitchell, who as the wife of United States Attorney General John Mitchell teetered so spectacularly between high spirits and dementia during the Watergate era. Now in John Jeter's ''Dirty Tricks,'' the redoubtable Judith Ivey has taken on the woman whose eagerness to share secrets and fears with the American people helped bring down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Ms. Ivey, as always, has vitality and skill to spare. But these assets are deployed in a vain attempt to paper over the seams in a conspicuously piecemeal play. Like its compulsively chatty heroine, ''Dirty Tricks'' is scattershot, hazy and, yes, desperate. Even with Ms. Ivey pouring on the cotillion-belle flirtiness and Southern discomfort, ''Dirty Tricks'' is nowhere near as entertaining or alarming as Mrs. Mitchell was at the height of her notoriety (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays. CHARLES ISHERWOOD * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative-writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60. BRANTLEY + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Last Chance *++ ''BRIAN DYKSTRA: CORNERED & ALONE.'' You won't find many Republicans at Mr. Dykstra's intoxicating one-man comic rant of a show, not when he describes George W. Bush as ''my A.D.D.-suffering, dyslexic, drunk-driving Bush Klan president with a 13-minute attention span, leaky brain pan'' -- we pause here to omit a deprecating anatomical reference -- and the ''I.Q. of a cracked blue soap dish.'' Too bad about the production's useless, less political first half-hour, but the audience is seated cabaret-style and drinks are served (1:30). Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. Tonight at 7. Tickets: $25. ANITA GATES *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n\u00e9 Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show. BRUCE WEBER 'SPATTER PATTERN (OR HOW I GOT THAT STORY)' Neal Bell's moody new play is a cautionary tale that proves the wisdom of avoiding one's neighbors. Edward Dunn (Peter Frechette), one of the dual protagonists, is a screenwriter still in shellshock over the death of his companion of more than two decades. Trying to jumpstart his stalled career, he moves into a pokey new studio apartment. His neighbor who turns out to be -- egad! -- a tabloid star, the Prof Who Offed the Co-ed, although the guilt of Marcus Tate (Darren Pettie) has yet to be proved. (He hasn't even been charged.) Edward, at emotional loose ends, strikes up a casual friendship with the celebrity next door. They are soon embroiled in a knotty psychological intimacy. Elements of Mr. Bell's murder-mystery plot suggest the playwright has logged more than a few ''Law & Order'' marathons in his television-watching diary. But the writing has a literate, high-toned shimmer that would probably bring out the red pencils from Dick Wolf's producers. Unfortunately the playwright is unable to meld these elements into a satisfying whole (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $38 to $45. ISHERWOOD + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. GATES Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. Now Playing 'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her long-time director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A. O. SCOTT 'CELSIUS 41.11: THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH THE BRAIN BEGINS TO DIE' Directed by Kevin Knoblock; written and produced by Lionel Chetwynd and Ted Steinberg (R, 71 minutes). If you don't know where the new film ''Celsius 41.11'' was coming from you certainly get the picture when the filmmakers cut from an image juxtaposing Michael Moore with Hitler straight to an image of John Kerry and John Edwards. If the juxtaposition weren't so shameless, if the political climate weren't so scurrilous, if the country were not actively at war and men, women and children were not dying in that war, this composite triumvirate of Moore-Hitler-Kerry might be easy to laugh off. As it is, it's a depressing indicator of our political discourse and what passes as nonfiction film these days. ''Celsius 41.11'' was made, according to a press release issued by Citizens United, the group that produced the film, ''to refute the propaganda in Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' '' On a basic level, this new feature is simply another addition to the mini-industry of detractors that has sprung up around Mr. Moore and taken on a more feverish pitch since his most recent screen success. But filmmakers behind ''Celsius 41.11'' spend surprisingly little time actually going after Mr. Moore. What Mr. Knoblock, Mr. Chetwynd and Mr. Steinberg want to do with their movie is make you afraid -- very, very afraid. MANOHLA DARGIS 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganza in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback. SCOTT 'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimuzu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that its taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat goes meo-o-o-ow. DARGIS * 'I HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope. DARGIS 'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism. DARGIS * 'LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE' Directed by Antoine Fuqua (PG-13, 104 minutes). The essential ingredients for playing and singing the blues are ''juice and pain,'' says Bonnie Raitt near the end of this remarkable concert documentary. By juice, Ms. Raitt means the raw life force that surges through the music of the blues legends who gathered at Radio City Music Hall on Feb. 26, 2003 for an historic and joyous musical summit. The film weaves performances from that concert with snippets of the musicians rehearsing and swapping stories backstage, and old film clips of legends like Lead Belly, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. The 30 performers in the concert (not counting a distinguished house band) include Ms. Raitt, Robert Cray, Solomon Burke and B. B. King. The film is moderately informative, the music intermittently thrilling. STEPHEN HOLDEN * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Tomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack its an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS 'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women. SCOTT 'SURVIVING CHRISTMAS' Starring Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara and Christina Applegate, Directed by Mike Mitchell (PG-13, 130 minutes). Hollywood's fizzled opening salvo in the year's seasonal sweepstakes, at first appears to have found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's sharklike grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character, a hot-shot millionaire ad man marketing spiked eggnog. Adrift at Christmas, he pays the hostile strangers who live in the house in which he grew up to give him the perfect family Christmas he never had. As you watch the comedy lurch along, the woozy, sinking sensation it produces suggests a movie slapped together after the consumption of far too many gallons of that spiked eggnog. HOLDEN * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism. SCOTT * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * PURNA DAS BAUL, Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park near Exit 9E, Grand Central Parkway, (718) 760-0064 or (212) 545-7536. Purna das Baul is the best-known singer among the Bauls of Bengal, a sect of wandering mistrels whose repertory has been handed down for centuries: rousing, clear-cut folk tunes driven by handclaps and drums. Tomorrow afternoon at 2; admission is $25, $20 for World Music Institute members. JON PARELES * CALIFONE, Brooklyn Fire Proof Inc., 101 Richardson Street, top floor, near Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4702. This tangled-roots indie-rock group finds unexpected connections between wriggly, freeform experiments and rattling, everything-in-the-junkyard folk music; the leader Tom Rutili loves to leave an unexpectedly pretty song half-buried in the debris. (Fans of weird, late-period Wilco should seek out Califone's lovely 2003 album, ''Quicksand/Cradlesnakes.'') The band's performance celebrates the opening of ''Series Two and Three,'' an exhibit of ''artwork from some of today's finest independent musicians,'' including Devendra Banhart, Tara Jane O'Neil, Jon Langford, Jad Fair and Mr. Rutili himself. Tonight at 10, with Bro. Danielson; admission is $10. KELEFA SANNEH * CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Marc Anthony Thompson, a k a Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes. His husky voice brings long-suffering passion to his twilit ballads, while his banter between songs can switch into comedy. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $15. PARELES * FELIX DA HOUSECAT, Avalon, 660 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. His new-wavey recent album, ''Devin Dazzle & the Neon Fever'' (Emperor Norton), is something of a disappointment: it has plenty of tongue-in-cheek glamour and a even a handful of smartly written songs, but his continuing obsession with the sights and sounds of 1980's nightlife is starting to seem like a joke in search of a punchline. Still, tonight you can expect the usual: one of the country's most entertaining D.J.'s, spinning a casual set full of robotic dance tracks and vocal-driven originals. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $35, with costume, $25. SANNEH * CONVERGE/CAVE IN, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Two Massachusetts bands stake out their own directions for the evolution of hard rock. Converge plays high-speed, high-impact rock that merges the fury of hardcore with the precision of math-metal. Cave In reaches back to psychedelia for ringing guitars and expansive melodies, adding its own kind of emotional turbulence. Tonight and tomorrow night at 6:30, with Between the Buried and Me opening; tickets are $12. PARELES CYPRESS HILL, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224 and Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. In a nagging singsong that has grown steadily less amusing as the years roll by, B-Real of Cypress Hill tells tales of pot-smoking, gunplay, paranoia and more pot-smoking. The formula is nearly threadbare. At Roseland tonight at 6:45, with the Alchemist and Lordz of Brooklyn opening; admission is $30. At Starland Ballroom tonight at 8; tickets are $23. PARELES * OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-2672. Oscar D'Leon, a suavely forceful singer and a bass-twirling bandleader from Venezuela, leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 1980's salsa. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $25, members, $10. PARELES * DRESDEN DOLLS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Keyboards, drums and Amanda Palmer's flamboyant voice are all the Dresden Dolls need to plunge into songs full of desperate passion and gothic extravagance: sometimes brutal, sometimes comic, always riveting. Tonight at 10:30, with Count Zero at 9:30 and the Ditty Bops at 8:30; admission is $15. PARELES * STEVE EARLE, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-1600. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Steve Earle's America is a place full of mavericks, outcasts and stubborn hope. His voice is scarred and raspy and his band is well rooted and far-reaching, playing generous sets that range across country and rock, from bluegrass to psychedelia. With the election impending, he's likely to draw on his politically tinged songs like the title track of his new album, ''The Revolution Starts Now'' (Artemis). At Webster Hall tomorrow night, with the gutsy country-rocker Allison Moorer sharing the bill; doors open at 6, and tickets are $30. At the Bowery Ballroom on Sunday night at 10:15, with the raunchy country evangelism of Tammy Faye Starlite at 9; tickets are $35. PARELES THE FLOWERS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A 35th-anniversary reunion for this pioneering dissident rock band from what was the Soviet Union. Tonight at 11:30; tickets are $50. PARELES GOGOL BORDELLO, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Gogol Bordello, led by a gruff and extravagantly mustachio'd Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, calls itself a gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oom-pah that's the makings of a rowdy party. Tomorrow night; doors open at 8, with Slavic Soul Party and Main Squeeze sharing the bill; tickets are $23.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow. PARELES * GREEN DAY, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900. Green Day put punk-pop on the charts a decade ago, and just in time to prevent the style from becoming completely twerpy, they have released ''American Idiot,'' no less than a rock opera about modern American culture that's as passionate as it is ambitious. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $33. PARELES HALLOWEEN CREEPSHOW, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. A Halloween day installment of the long-running New York City rock 'n' roll DJ party (its name won't be appearing in these pages any time soon), starring a fistful of D.J.'s and -- one hopes -- some cleverly-attired revelers. In the main room, you can expect to hear ''possessed rock 'n' roll, puke-green punk, nosferatu new-wave & devilish disco'': the usual, in other words. Here's hoping for at least one tasteless Ray Charles costume, and at least one even-more-tasteless Christopher Reeve. Sunday night at 10; admission is $20, or $15 in advance. But be warned: even if you have a ticket, you have to get dressed up or you won't get in. SANNEH HERMAN'S HERMITS/MICKEY DOLENZ/GARY LEWIS AND THE PLAYBOYS/SPENCER DAVIS GROUP, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800. From both sides of the Atlantic, 1960's oldies reflecting the aftermath of the British Invasion. Tonight at 8; tickets are $41.50. PARELES * BRUCE HORNSBY, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Bruce Hornsby, who spent much of the 1990's touring as the pianist with the Grateful Dead and its spinoffs, and the experience transformed his own music. Even in earnest songs, he's freer and more playful, letting loose his two-handed virtuosity so that songs dance through jazz, gospel, country, Latin music and rock. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 and $45. PARELES INTI-ILLIMANI, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. Inti-Illimani, from Chile, is fond of both traditional Andean music and the hybrids that layer together native American, Spanish and African elements. With traditional flutes, panpipes, percussion and charango (small guitar) alongside clarinets and fiddle, the group's repertory includes new songs in courtly, old-fashioned styles along with traditional tunes. Tonight at 8 and 10; tickets are $25. PARELES JET/THE DONNAS, Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940. Choose your 1970's throwback: the early part of the decade for the swaggering, riffing AC/DC revival of Jet or the late 1970's of the Runaways for the punk-pop of the Donnas. Tonight at 8; tickets: $25. Sold out; returns may be available. PARELES * LADYFEST EAST, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. A punk-inspired festival featuring a wide range of music, art, film, poetry, theater and comedy by women. (For a full schedule, and for information on festival passes, visit www.ladyfesteast.org.) Tonight at 8, the headliner is the barebones blues-punk band the Gossip; tickets are $13. Tomorrow night at 7:30, the headliner is the Butchies, known for their (sometimes deceptively) straightforward punkish love songs; tickets are $13. Sunday at noon; the headliner is the Richmon, Va., emo band Del Cielo; tickets are $10. SANNEH * MEDESKI, MARTIN AND WOOD/ANTIBALAS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Medeski, Martin and Wood's jams can take them in any direction, from old-fashioned funk organ trio to free jazz, but they know how to keep the dance floor happy. Antibalas gets its funk by way of Nigeria, where Fela Kuti concocted Afrobeat to meld politics and propulsion; it's a large band that has made Fela's burly grooves its own. Sunday night, doors open at 6; tickets are $32. PARELES PBS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Broadcasting funk from New Orleans, PBS is the Funky Meters minus the keyboardist Art Neville; it includes George Porter Jr. on bass, Russell Batiste on drums and Brian Stoltz on guitar, with some guest musicians. Tonight at midnight; tickets are $25. PARELES * ROBERT RANDOLPH AND THE FAMILY BAND/KAKI KING/CITIZEN COPE, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. Until a few years ago, Robert Randolph did most of his performing at the House of God church in Orange, N. J., playing gospel songs on pedal steel guitar. But Mr. Randolph's group has emerged into the secular realm of jam bands, which have embraced both his rip-roaring virtuosity and his gift for making his instrument sing without a word. Sharing the bill are Kaki King, a virtuoso acoustic guitarist, and Citizen Cope, who songs often moan like slow Southern rock. Tomorrow night at 6:45; admission is $25. PARELES * DANNY TENAGLIA, Ikon, 610 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-8282. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- house music D.J.'s. Expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to dance music, but for his extraordinary stamina, too. Tonight after 10; tickets are $25 in advance, more at the door. SANNEH * GLENN TILBROOK AND FLUFFERS, THE SMITHEREENS, MARSHALL CRENSHAW, GRAHAM PARKER, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Survivors from the pop side of new wave rock gather in a concert that should be filled with smart lyrics and succinct tunes. The lineup features Glenn Tilbrook, who was the higher, smoother singer and half of the songwriting partnership of Squeeze; the Smithereens, who put just a little punk muscle into folk-rock; Marshall Crenshaw, whose songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles, and Graham Parker, once a cantankerous pub-rocker whose recent songs come to terms with the disappointments and contentments of adulthood. Tonight at 7; admission is $60. PARELES * ANGIE STONE/ANTHONY HAMILTON, Newark Symphony Hall, 1020 Broad Street, Newark, (973) 643-8009. On albums, neo-soul is hemmed in by trying to sound like brittle, hop-hop-flavored rhythm-and-blues. Onstage, singers can get more intimate and more dynamic. Angie Stone sings her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. Anthony Hamilton's version of neo-soul doesn't bother with vocal gymastics. Mr. Hamilton, who sings about love, loyalty and growing up in the South, and on stage he lets loose the revival-tent fervor of old Southern soul. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $56.50 and $76.50. PARELES * SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this a cappella group of women, who never forget to leaven righteousness with pleasure. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $23 to $68. PARELES SWITCHFOOT, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. A little grunge, a little new wave and a lot of positive thinking and Christian imagery add up to the songs of Switchfoot, which has a religious answer for its existential yearning. Tonight at 7, with the Honorary Title and the Format opening; tickets are $22. PARELES TABOU COMBO, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Tabou Combo has been around since the 1960's; it transferred the lilt of the Haitian compas from big bands to a small group with guitars and keyboards, and it suavely segues funk and salsa back to the gentle bounce of the compas. Tonight at 11, with Zin; tickets are $22. PARELES * TIGER LILLIES, Peter Jay Sharpe Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400.If Kurt Weill had come out of English music halls, and had some grotesque nightmares along the way, his music might sound like the macabre and bouncy tunes of the Tiger Lillies. It's a trio that features Martyn Jacques's hooting accordion and piercing falsetto in tales of outcasts, addicts, hustlers and ghouls, perfect for Halloween. Sunday at 8; tickets are $25, $23 for members. PARELES THE WAILERS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Three members of the band that backed Bob Marley -- Al Anderson on guitar, Earl Wya Lindo on keyboards and Aston Barrett on bass -- are still the core of the Wailers, whose rhythms transformed reggae and rock forever. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 the day of the show. PARELES * THE WALKMEN, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-1600.The Walkmen, one of New York City's finest bands, put a frazzled edge on songs that have absorbed New York rock from the Velvet Underground and electric Bob Dylan to the Ramones and the Contortions. They have the jangle of too much caffeine after too little sleep, in songs that sound like arguments that won't end. It's brawny, bristling rock with a point to every loose end. Tonight, doors open at 7 and the Hackensaw Boys and Walking Stalking Walters share the bill; tickets are $20. PARELES Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. WES ANDERSON/KENGO NAKAMURA QUARTET, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7000. Wes Anderson has been an alto saxophonist in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and in Wynton Marsalis's own groups since the late 1980's; he's got a clean, sweet, flexible style that can remind you of Cannonball Adderley. He leads the band with Kengo Nakamura, a bassist who's been playing around New York since the 90's in bands led by Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Golson and others. Tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $10. BEN RATLIFF BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine, if overlooked, records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. He swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music that sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and a $10 minimum. RATLIFF * BRASIL LIVRE! Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. The Brazilian multi-instrumentalist and composer Hermeto Pascoal, a real outside-the-box thinker and cult hero in hardcore jazz circles, doesn't perform in America much. It's a coup to have him for two nights in Rose Hall's Allen Room in the new Jazz at Lincoln Center complex. He performs on a bill with Beat the Donkey, a boisterous percussion ensemble led by the Brazilian-born percussionist Cyro Baptista. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30; tickets are $10 to $150. RATLIFF RON CARTER NONET/REGINA CARTER QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Carter, the bassist, never quits readjusting his focus, from classical to Brazilian to straight-ahead jazz. Ms. Carter, the classically trained violinist, has been pretty successful at mixing virtuosity with popular appeal: when she makes blues and gospel figures out of portamento swoops, it's hard not to like her. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35 and a $5 minimum. RATLIFF JIMMY COBB'S MOB, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. One of the original hard-bop drummers and the only surviving musician from Miles Davis's ''Kind of Blue'' sessions, Jimmy Cobb plays hard-edged, straight-ahead jazz with his own band. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20. RATLIFF DIZZY GILLESPIE FESTIVAL, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. The second week of the mini-festival celebrating both this new club's opening and Dizzy Gillespie's birthday. Its theme is Gillespie's big band repertory, and Paquito D'Rivera Sextet is playing it. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar. RATLIFF * CHARLIE HADEN QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Following up ''Nocturne,'' a record of Cuban boleros, the great jazz bassist Mr. Haden has created ''Land of the Sun'' (Verve), an album of ballads mostly by the Mexican composer Jose Sabre Marroqu\u00edn. Again, he's got the Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in his band, and together they render the emotion of the bolero finely-wrought lowercase. There is beauty and incredible tension here; the music from ''Nocturne'' was even better in performance and probably this will be, too. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF MULGREW MILLER AND WINGSPAN, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Miller has a soulful sensitivity that made him the reliable standard for mainstream jazz piano over the last 20 years. He's not a housewrecker; he just sets his music in order and knows what to do. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF 'VISION CLUB': JOE MORRIS, CHARLES GAYLE, ET AL., Vision Club, Brunstein Showroom, 13 Stanton Street, between Chrystie and Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681. A new concert series continues, creating different pairings within experimental jazz. At 8 p.m., the guitarist Joe Morris plays in a trio with Louis Belogenis and Rashid Bakr, and at 10, Charles Gayle's trio takes over, with the bassist Hill Greene and the drummer Lou Grassi. Tomorrrow night; admission is $10 per set or $15 for the night. RATLIFF * ERIC REVIS'S 11:11, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The bassist Eric Revis is best known as a member of Branford Marsalis's quartet, and he's just recently put out a record with a wide, persuasive vision; the hard rhythm is always there, but he's been listening to Bill Frisell, Ornette Coleman and a lot of other things. His band is a wrecking crew: the harmonica player Gregoire Maret, the saxophonist John Ellis, the guitarist Oz Noy and the drummer Jeff Watts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; cover charge is $15. RATLIFF MELVIN RHYNE ORGAN TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369. A dependable Hammond organ player who used to play with Wes Montgomery. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $15. RATLIFF ANDY SUMMERS TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. Some years after the Police broke up, the band's guitarist dived into a jazz career, starting to put out albums reflecting his interest in most of the things working jazz musicians are concerned with -- Mingus and Monk and Brazilian music, among others. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum. RATLIFF Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. * KAREN AKERS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Akers brings back ''Time After Time,'' her acclaimed salute to the traditional love song. Demure and statuesque with an air of aristocratic reserve, she retains the formality of a concert performer while delivering beautifully intoned, deeply felt versions of standards that include ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' ''Falling in Love With Love,'' ''Time After Time'' and ''Loving You.'' It is as romantically satisfying a cabaret show as you'll ever find. Don Rebic accompanies on piano. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, with a late show tomorrow night at 10:30. Cover $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at one least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90. HOLDEN Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera often succeeds in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Everyone involved in the current revival can more or less make the thing fly, led by Dolora Zajick as an Amneris whose ringing mezzo threatens to blow everyone else offstage, and the excellent Marcello Viotti in the pit. A couple of new singers step into the cast tonight: Angela M. Brown takes on the title role and Anooshah Golesorkhi brings his firm baritone to the part of her father, Amonasro. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200. ANNE MIDGETTE 'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty op\u00e9ra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival: Irina Mishura takes on Carmen; and Eduardo Villa sings Don Jos\u00e9. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Mica\u00ebla, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. An additional tenor will be present in the pit: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. MIDGETTE 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' Opera audiences and opera companies never tire of pairing Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' surely the most popular one-act Italian operas ever, in a double bill. Franco Zeffirelli's scrupulously realistic production returns to the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow afternoon. Aside from the intriguing casting of the powerhouse Russian tenor Vladimir Galouzine as Canio in ''Pagliacci,'' once Caruso's signature role, the casting looks solid and promising, with Juan Pons as Tonio and Daniela Dess\u00ec as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' along with Eva Urbanova as Santuzza and Fabio Armiliato as Turiddu in ''Cavalleria.'' The main interest should be the conducting of Dennis Russell Davies. Over the years New York audiences have mostly heard him in orchestra programs with a bracing quotient of contemporary works. But Mr. Davies has been a major presence in European opera houses. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. ANTHONY TOMMASINI 'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES' Poulenc's elegant meditation on death, in this new and blessedly simple New York City Opera production by Tazewell Thompson, continues its run tonight. Poulenc, the charming boulevardier and tasteful sentimentalist, turns his attention here to serious matters: namely faith, martyrdom and the French Revolution. George Manahan conducts. The largely female cast includes Rinat Shaham, Sarah Coburn, Joyce Castle, Eugenie Grunewald, Gwynne Geyer and Gloria Parker. Worth a trip. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105. BERNARD HOLLAND 'THE SATIN CLOAK' Martin Halpern's pleasant little folk-parable opera about a cobbler who becomes a ruler had its premiere at the minute company Operaworks in 2001; now, Mimi Stern-Wolfe, an indefatigable presenter of opera and music on a shoestring for the last 20 years, is presenting a new production of the piece with her Downtown Chamber Players. Possible improvements include the addition of live musical accompaniment (as opposed to Operaworks's ''virtual orchestra'') and September Bigelow, a rich-voiced young mezzo-soprano, in the role of the cobbler's wife. It remains to be seen if Mr. Halpern, who will also direct, can match the antic charm of the original production. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $21, $12 for 65+ and students. MIDGETTE 'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E-flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. Since the start of this revival in September, she's been joined by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine, strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. Atsushi Yamada conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115. MIDGETTE Classical Music EMANUELE ARCIULI Since his American debut in 1998 in Cincinnati, the Italian pianist Emanuele Arciuli has performed almost every season in New York, attracting attention and audiences in particular for his brilliant and probing performances of contemporary music. Two years ago at Columbia University's Miller Theater he presented ''Round Monk Variations,'' the results of a commissioning project in which he asked some 20 composers to write works in response to Thelonious Monk's jazz classic ''Round Midnight.'' Tonight Mr. Arciuli is back at Columbia for a recital of 20th- century works by, among others, Cage, Feldman, John Adams, Karlheinz Stockhausen and a world premiere by Alessandro Sbordoni. You can expect Mr. Arciuli's playing to be as compelling as his program is adventurous. Tonight at 6:30, Casa Italiana, Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-4437. Free. TOMMASINI BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend, the small stage of the barge will be crowded with the Knights of the Many-Sided Table, a 10-piece chamber ensemble formed by young, up-and-coming New York-based string players. Tonight's program features the perennially popular Serenade for Strings by Tchaikovsky alongside Armenian folk songs and music by Shostakovich. Tomorrow and Sunday, the Knights are joined at their proverbial table by the accomplished flutist Paula Robison in music by Ginastera, Bartok and others. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $75. JEREMY EICHLER CHOIR OF CORPUS CHRISTI CHURCH AND PARTHENIA The Music Before 1800 series presents a handful of superb early music ensembles from around the world, but not to be overlooked are the illuminating programs by the resident Choir of Corpus Christi Church, conducted by Louise Basbas. On Sunday, the choir is supported by Parthenia, a fine viol consort, in music by Monteverdi, Viadana, Wert, Salamone Rossi and both Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+. ALLAN KOZINN THE ENGLISH CONCERT This pioneering period-instrument group, based in London, was big in the 1970's and 80's, but it seemed to lose steam toward the end of Trevor Pinnock's tenure as founding director. If anyone can re-energize it, it should be the electrifying violinist Andrew Manze, its new leader. Several Vivaldi concertos will afford ample display of Mr. Manze's virtuosity here. The other repertory ranges from the overfamiliar (Mozart's ''Kleine Nachtmusik'') to the obscure (a serenata by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer). Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $56. JAMES R. OESTREICH JUILLIARD SYMPHONY James DePreist, the music director of the Oregon Symphony for many years (and now its laureate music director), recently took over the conducting and orchestral studies programs at the Juilliard School. A concert with the school's orchestra last year showed the considerable degree of promise this collaboration holds, and tonight, Mr. DePreist leads the Juilliard Symphony in a program that should challenge the school's young musicians. Included are Christopher Rouse's Symphony No. 1, Weber's Bassoon Concerto and a hefty chunk of Wagner, including ''Ride of the Valkyries,'' the ''Prelude and Liebestod'' from ''Tristan und Isolde,'' and the ''Immolation Scene'' from ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4merung.'' Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Free, but reservations are required. KOZINN MOSCOW VIRTUOSI This dependably good chamber orchestra often showcases the music of its home country, but in this case Shostakovich is the lone Russian composer on the program. Still, there should be plenty of other riches to compensate including Schoenberg's ravishing ''Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht'' and the memorable Sextet from Strauss's ''Capriccio.'' With the eloquent Vladimir Spivakov at the helm, the group certainly need not hire outside violin soloists. Instead, Mr. Spivakov will play Mozart's Second Violin Concerto (K. 211) as well as Bach's Concerto for Violin and Oboe (BWV 1060). Sunday afternoon at 3, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $54. EICHLER * PAMELA Z Think Meredith Monk meets ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and you'll get some inkling of the sound of ''Voci,'' an evening-length work by the classically trained vocalist and performance artist Pamela Z that's having its first New York performances. Based in San Francisco, acclaimed internationally, Ms. Z explores a wide range of sounds: some made with her own voice, spoken or sung, and some created through sampling or electronic processing. ''Voci,'' a multi-media, evening-length piece, focuses on her instrument of preference, exploring various permutations of the human voice, including some virtual duets with Ms. Z and other performers who appear as video samples. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+. MIDGETTE ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC This is the third of the orchestra's three concerts at Carnegie Hall. The music has been, and continues to be, Russian. Lynn Harrell (not Russian) is the soloist in the Shostakovich Cello Concerto. Yuri Temirkanov conducts it and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Russian Easter'' Overture and the Tchaikovsky Sixth Symphony as well. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $29 to $115. HOLLAND Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's autumn season, which continues through Nov. 7, features a rich assortment of one-act works ideally suited for a space in which dramatic details come into vivid focus. Tomorrow night, Marcelo Gomes plays Henry VIII in ''VIII'' and Carmen Corella and Xiomara Reyes are two of his doomed wives, while Paloma Herrera makes her debut in that ballet on Sunday night, when Angel Corella and Julie Kent once again portray the other major roles. On Sunday afternoon, Veronika Part and Maxim Beloserkovsky star in the light-hearted ''Angelina Ballerina.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., City Center, West 55th Street, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $35 to $80. JACK ANDERSON * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, which Mr. Dennis co-founded. The film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters who include Mark Russell, for many years the theater's director and animating spirit. Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 14) at 2 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5. JENNIFER DUNNING 'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m., Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85. DUNNING FRIDAYS AT NOON This free series, which features informal programs of new dances and a chance to question the choreographers, will present work today by Emma Cotter, Barbara Mahler and Rachel Schroeder. Today at noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org. DUNNING GRUPO CORPO This Brazilian troupe fuses ballet, jazz, modern-dance and Afro-Brazilian dance styles in choreography and performing that has been praised for its sensuality and energy. Samba, anyone, with a Martha Graham contraction? Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday at 2:30 p.m., New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722 or www.njpac.org. Tickets: $38. DUNNING MANDANCE PROJECT Eliot Feld's new choreographic endeavor brings together five men (Damian Woetzel, Wu-Kang Chen, Nickemil Concepcion, Jason Jordan and Sean Suozzi) and one woman (Patricia Tuthill) in solos, duets and group works by Mr. Feld to music ranging from Bach to jug band tunes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tomorrow at 2 and Sunday at 3 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42; matinees, $25 for adults, $15 for children. ANDERSON * MERI\u00c1N SOTO DANCE & PERFORMANCE Ms. Soto's new ''M\u00e1quina del Tiempo'' (''Time Machine'') is a full-evening piece in three parts that explores popular dance and music forms as ''time machines,'' which reveal much about their eras. The multi-media piece draws on post-modern dance and the improvisational salsa, hip-hop, swing and mambo. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25. DUNNING * \u00d1ACHO-\u00d1ACHO GYPSY STORYTELLER Spain and India might not seem to have much in common culturally, but programs of flamenco and Indian classical dance tend to be as exciting as they are intriguingly complementary. Andrea Del Conte will represent flamenco and Narayana Charka will represent Indian classical Kathak dance in a program that explores the rich historical connections between these two old dance forms. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Lotus Studios, 109 West 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 627-1076 or www.lotusarts.com. Tickets: $25. DUNNING NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: RALPH LEMON Mr. Lemon's ambitious cross-cultural ''Geography Trilogy'' concludes with ''Come home Charley Patton,'' a theatrical mosaic that combines dance, music, storytelling, literature and video to examine how memory is passed down from one generation to the next. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $45. ANDERSON OUT OF SPACE @ BRIC STUDIO Presented by both the studio and the Danspace Project at St. Mark's, the series' program this weekend sounds about as eclectic as you can get. Daman Harun will present a solo exploring place and displacement. Mina Nishimura's solo creates an abstract landscape of experimentation with time and space. Smruti Patel blends Indian classical and American contemporary dance. And the Usaama Dance Company of New Jersey, a group of young girls, will perform West African dance and song. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, BRIC Studio, 57 Rockwell Place, around the corner from the BAM Harvey Theater, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882. Tickets: $10. DUNNING SAINT MICHAEL'S WARRIORS DANCE COMPANY This weekend's wild-card dance attraction, the Bronx-based Warriors fuse biblical stories, Christian messages and hip-hop, ballet, modern and African and jazz dance styles, all performed to rock music. This is their debut. Say you saw them when. Tonight at 8, All Angels Church, 251 West 80th Street, Manhattan, (347) 675-2392 or www.saintmichaelswarriors.org. Tickets: $12; $8, students and 65+. DUNNING SOKOLOW THEATER DANCE ENSEMBLE Anna Sokolow's 50th anniversary as a choreographer will be celebrated here by a program of her dances, including her signature ''Rooms,'' set to live music by a jazz ensemble and performed by dancers directed by Jim May, Sokolow's longtime associate. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+. DUNNING * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m., S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15. DUNNING TRINAYAN COLLECTIVE This New York-based group, which specializes in the sensuous, lyrical Odissi form of Indian classical dance, will present ''Neel: The Eternal Blue,'' a meditation on the divine. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 598-9085. Tickets: $25; $20 for students and 65+. DUNNING WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: BALE FOLCLORIC DA BAHIA The 30-member Brazilian troupe is known for explosive drumming and frenzied dancing. Batten down the hatches. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or www .worldmusicinstitute.org. Tickets: $32; $45; $15 for students with identification. The company will perform tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $10 to $48. DUNNING Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums 'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3. KEN JOHNSON * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry, and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+. HOLLAND COTTER 'THE BISHOP JADES,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through January 2006. Jade has always been imbued with moral and spiritual meaning in China. Luminous and quick to warm to the touch, it must have seemed heaven sent when first discovered, embedded in boulders washed down from mountains in Central Asia. Yet because it is unusually hard, direct carving was all but impossible. Slow abrasion was the only way to manipulate it. It has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. They range in size from two-inch-high figurines of astrological creatures to a hefty green basin modeled on an even larger one made for Kublai Khan. In style they run from a no-frills, starched-white incense burner with a fluted surface to a couple of all-frills vases with dragons perched on the rim and fruit spilling down the side. Also included are jade versions of archaic bronzes, a reminder of the fundamental conservatism of Chinese art, and examples of Indian Mughal jades of a kind Qing connoisseurs flipped over. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. COTTER * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours and admission: see above. COTTER * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantles worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It pinpoints paintings by Arnold B\u00f6cklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield; places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context; and includes reconstructions of puppets made and used in performance by Heartfield, George Grosz and Hannah H\u00f6ch. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Saturdays to Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7. SMITH * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH 'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here, with short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+. GRACE GLUECK 'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 2. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these statuettes, from the 15th to the mid-18th centuries and assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students. GLUECK * 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting American Indian art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free. GLUECK 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 62+, $4. GLUECK * 'IN THE REALM OF GODS AND KINGS: ARTS OF INDIA SELECTIONS FROM THE POLSKY COLLECTIONS AND THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 2, and 'WHEN GOLD BLOSSOMS: INDIAN JEWELRY FROM THE COLLECTION OF SUSAN L. BENINGSON,' through Jan. 23, Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. Of these two collection shows, ''In the Realm of Gods and Kings'' is the more varied. Made up mostly of small, precious objects, it leaps from ancient sculpture to contemporary photography, but concentrates on miniature paintings from the 16th through the 19th centuries. It's a visually stunning, speeded-up trip through a high-end version of Indian art, and intellectually stimulating as a demonstration of how social and spiritual worlds can reflect each other. The jewelry in the Beningson show furthers this idea with lots of razzle and dazzle. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; 65+, $7; students, $5; under 16, free. COTTER 'THE LANGUAGE OF NATIVE AMERICAN BASKETS,' National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, through Jan. 9. Woven by hand from carefully cultivated roots and plants, a basket could be a baby carrier, a saddlebag, a purse, a bowl for cooking or serving, a tray, a jar, a water bottle, a fish trap, a trunk, a seed scoop, a hat or even a coffin. This vivacious show presents more than 200 examples of basket making in the museum's collection, going back to the early 19th century. And it also displays work by five present-day practitioners, part of a growing number helping to keep the tradition alive. Besides its aesthetic pleasures, this show provides abundant proof of that tradition's vivacity. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly magazine in 1972, Life was this country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show is a reminder of the many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism, package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Nina Leen's suburban housewives as exotic species -- under shiny hairdryers or surrounded by their new appliances -- are among the forgotten masterpieces of mid-century Americana. She has one of the show's encapsulating views: a gauzy photograph, from the back, of a mother with two small children in their pajamas, holding hands in the slanting light of the late afternoon on a suburban platform, watching as the train pulls in. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. KIMMELMAN 'MASTERPIECES OF AMERICAN JEWELRY,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Jan. 23. A production of the National Jewelry Institute, this exhibition presents about 150 pieces of exquisite high-quality jewelry from the late 18th century to the late 20th century. Its organization is less than illuminating but individual pieces are marvelous. Included are a Walt Disney Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs charm bracelet; gold nut-and-bolt cufflinks by the witty designer Paul Flato; a diamond, ruby and sapphire American flag brooch the size of a playing card, by Tiffany; and opulent necklaces, bracelets and brooches in various traditional styles from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and other famous firms. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $7. JOHNSON * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the Vietnam War. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of that era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours and admission: see above. SMITH 'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; the painters Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. Among the impressive results are the wonderful ''Catherine Brass Yates,'' an exquisite likeness of a middle-aged woman elegantly plying a needle as her long narrow face regards the viewer with a cool stare. ''The Skater (William Grant),'' done in 1782, is a stunning full-length figure of an acquaintance from Stuart's London days performing a graceful maneuver on the ice. It is, far and beyond being a portrait, a haunting work whose liberating air seems to extol the individual as master of his fate. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK Galleries: Uptown 'BOB THE ROMAN: HEROIC ANTIQUITY AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF ROBERT ADAM,' Gallery of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street, (212) 472-1500, through Dec. 4. Not for nothing did the Scotsman Robert Adam (1728-1792) playfully restyle himself ''Bob the Roman'' after soaking up the Eternal City on his youthful grand tour of Europe. Nearly everything he turned his hand to later as the celebrated architect, designer and interior decorator of late 18th-century England evoked the classical spirit of his beloved Rome. This show of more than 80 drawings made in the Adam office (Robert's brother, James, was his partner) is an enlightening introduction to the Adam brothers' scope. The works range from a nine-foot-long view of the facade of an intricate fantasy palace to numerous plans and proposals for town houses, villas and castles, along with their ornamentation, many of which actually got built. The show provides a fine glimpse of Robert Adam's role in helping to put an elegant and decorative new face on 18th-century English architecture. GLUECK ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although thought of today primarily as a realist painter, Alfred Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world whose studio was a center of happenings and other events besides painting. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points. GLUECK * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism. SMITH Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Nov. 22. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON Galleries: Chelsea JEFF LADOUCEUR: 'SCHMO,' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through Nov. 13. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopuses and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching. JOHNSON Other Galleries 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses. SMITH 'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 Tenth Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Nov. 21. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the President's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the President humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq. JOHNSON Last Chance * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE' AND 'NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through tomorrow An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus, but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. It also confirms that the only good scale is human scale and that new land should be used reluctantly and carefully, like the precious and finite commodity it is. A show within a show of 40 houses by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. SMITH KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through tomorrow. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past, but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices. GLUECK FRITZ BULTMAN, ''Irascible II: Abstract Expressionist Paintings, Circa 1960,'' Schlesinger, 24 East 73rd Street, (212) 734-3600, through tomorrow. In the late 1950's and early 60's, this Abstract Expressionist was in top form, judging by the eight small- to medium-size canvases in this show. He wasn't doing anything that Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline didn't do, but his impetuous, sensuously crusty paintings have an urgency of their own that still feels fresh. JOHNSON TONY DE LOS REYES, ''The Strange Tale of Near and Far,'' DCKT Contemporary, 537 West 24th Street, SoHo, (212) 741-9955, through tomorrow. From a distance it looks as if Mr. de los Reyes is in engaged in an eccentric revival of some antique tradition. He paints images of 17th-century ships at sea and detailed images of wild plants and flowers in shades of blue and white like Delftware. Up close you discover that these glossy pictures are made by distinctively modern methods of pouring, pooling and manipulating liquid paint. JOHNSON NICOLA HICKS, Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, between 77th and 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through tomorrow. This accomplished British sculptor combines neo-Classical traditionalism, surrealistic mythology and Modernist raw materialism in bronze and painted plaster representations of humans and animals. The life-size reclining nude attended by winged putti veers toward old school academicism, but the portraits of dogs and the muscular head of a Minotaur have much vitality. JOHNSON WILLIAM HUDDERS, Tatistcheff, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4547, through tomorrow. If you gave this exhibition of neatly painted views of Long Island City-scapes and still-life pictures of shoes, apples and glassware just a quick glance you might peg it as the work of an earnestly conservative recent art school graduate. The more you look, however, the more inexplicably odd, sweet and subtly humorous these cannily simplified pictures seem. Influences of De Chirico and Hopper are evident, but Mr. Hudders has his own engaging way with the poetry of ordinary things. JOHNSON * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074, through tomorrow. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. particularly as they shape the lives of women. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power. COTTER STONE ROBERTS, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through tomorrow. Mr. Roberts aims for a kind of Victorian revivalism in his big paintings of well-to-do New Yorkers inside and outside their well-appointed homes. Apparently copied from photographs, they are made with assiduous attention to detail, and from a distance the realist illusionism is impressive if not colorful. The narrative psychology is vapid, however, and under close-up inspection, the paint is lifeless.

Theater Broadway + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95. BEN BRANTLEY + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25. CHARLES ISHERWOOD * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. 7 p.m. curtain through Nov. 18. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25. BRANTLEY *+ 'GUANT\u00c1NAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. BRANTLEY ++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays. ISHERWOOD 'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD + 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25. ISHERWOOD + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe, and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. Now Playing 'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies (see, at your peril, the oeuvre of the filmmaker James Toback), but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges. MANOHLA DARGIS 'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A.O. SCOTT 'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re wrote many scripts for Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. As the mood shifts ingeniously from gothic to romance to comedy of manners, her emotions play in counterpoint, flickering from light-heartedness to uncertainty to full-eyed sorrow. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can. SCOTT 'ENDURING LOVE' Starring Daniel Craig, Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton. Directed by Roger Michell (R, 100 minutes). In the new British film ''Enduring Love,'' Mr. Ifans plays the part of the scorned lover with neurasthenic delicacy and a spidery creepiness. Lanky and loose-limbed, Mr. Ifans has fine flaxen hair that occasionally brushes into his eyes, a bit of peek-a-boo that in the role of Jed Parry, scorned lover and full-bore psychopath, the actor transforms into a gesture of unsettling coquetry. Jed loves Joe (Mr. Craig), who in turn loves Claire (Ms. Morton), who in the way of the world and tragic romances, mostly seems to love herself. Theirs is a roundelay of misunderstanding and bruising, modern disconnection. Based on the novel by the English writer Ian McEwan and directed by Mr. Michell, an Englishman who's probably best known for the grating romantic comedy ''Notting Hill'' and should be known more for the pulp thriller ''Changing Lanes,'' ''Enduring Love'' is a serious movie about love, principally its petty cruelties and monstrous disguises. Soft, tender love, the kind that wraps you in comfort and warmth, much less the kind that sends you over the moon, is almost nonexistent in this curious, lachrymose story. DARGIS 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganza in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke as the team's star runner and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback. SCOTT * ''GARDEN STATE,'' starring Zach Braff, Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. Written and directed by Mr. Braff (R, 102 minutes). This small, smart, off-kilter comedy has the cheek to present itself as ''The Graduate 2004,'' although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as ''The Anti-Graduate 2004.'' From its story of the waking up of an emotionally numbed young man (Mr. Braff) to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack, the movie obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles, is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because ''The Graduate'' established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through ''American Beauty'' and beyond, you expect ''Garden State'' to uphold the clich\u00e9. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, ''Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a clich\u00e9 by turning it inside out is a worthy one. STEPHEN HOLDEN 'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat goes meo-o-o-ow. DARGIS * 'I HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, Mr. Russell says, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope. DARGIS * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes try to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced them into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Anything but dull and ordinary, this computer-animated feature has a clean and vibrant visual style and is organized around a strong, fascinating idea. Mr. Bird (''The Iron Giant'') uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world where ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology and trades in its subtlety for noise and over-familiar thrills. SCOTT 'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism. DARGIS * ''MARIA FULL OF GRACE,'' starring Catalina Sandino Moreno and Yenny Paola Vega. Written and directed by Joshua Marston (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Ms. Sandino) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms. Sandino's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromise but never undermine her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. HOLDEN * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out. SCOTT 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS 'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women. SCOTT * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism. SCOTT * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ERIC ANDERSEN, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Since the 1960's, Eric Andersen has been picking his guitar and singing about love in wistfully graceful songs like ''Thirsty Boots'' and ''Blue River.'' Lately, he's started to reflect about the passing decades and collaborate with songwriters like Lou Reed and John Prine. Tonight at 9:30; tickets are $20 and there is a $12 minimum. JON PARELES BACILOS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Bacilos, from Miami, draw their rock en espa\u00f1ol from across the Americas, switching gracefully and tunefully amid cumbia, salsa, bossa nova and pop ballads, and they have a Grammy Award (Best Latin Pop Album) and hit singles to show for it. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $30. PARELES BEASTIE BOYS/TALIB KWELI, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, L.I., (631) 888-9000. The Beastie Boys are now old-school and proud of it, and their most recent album, ''To the Five Boroughs'' (Capitol), harks back to the electro blips of one of their early idols, Afrika Bambaata. Now that they're filled with good intentions, they're not as much fun as they were in their early days as uninhibited brats. Talib Kweli is an ambitious rapper who packs everything into his rhymes from politics to romance to anti-gangsta admonitions, all without forgetting to boast. Tonight at 7: tickets are $30.50 to $41. PARELES EARLIMART, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Earlimart has a streak of Neil Young folkiness, a streak of psychedelia and, on its latest album, an eerie echo of Elliott Smith, combined in ever-shifting proportions. Tonight at 9, with Midnight Movies, Silver Sun Pickups and the Love Story opening; admission is $8. PARELES FATBOY SLIM, Drive-In Studios, 443 West 18th Street, near Ninth Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 807-6795. Formerly a superstar D.J., now merely a star D.J., Fatboy Slim pursues his own gregarious vision of dance music: he likes big, memorable vocal samples; basslines so fat you can sing them, not just dance to them; exuberant beats that evoke the buoyant spirit (and sometimes sound) of pre-disco dance music. His new album, ''Palookaville'' (Astralwerks), is even more song-oriented than its predecessors -- it includes ''Put It Back Together,'' a lovely ballad sung by Damon Albarn of Blur. Unfortunately, the album is mainly filled with thin grooves and threadbare ideas. (The low point might be Bootsy Collins singing Steve Miller's ''The Joker.'') But this should be a good party regardless -- don't be surprised if Fatboy finds ways to bring many of these album tracks to life. Tomorrow night at 9:30 ; tickets are $40. KELEFA SANNEH * GIANT SAND/HANDSOME FAMILY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Howe Gelb's songs for Giant Sand ponder big questions of mortality, love and fate in music with a skewed Southwestern spirit: sometimes quiet, sometimes twanging and lurching toward chaos. Brett and Rennie Sparks, who are husband and wife, write music and lyrics respectively for the Handsome Family. Their songs are part of alternative country's surreal and morbid wing. In stately melodies, often waltzes, Brett Sparks's serene baritone imparts tales of lost love and sentiments like, ''It's only human to want to kill a beautiful thing.'' Tonight, with Low Skies opening at 8:30; admission is $15. PARELES ROBYN HITCHCOCK, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Tightly wound melodies and unsprung narratives meet in Robyn Hitchcock's songs, which bridge the psychedelia of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett and the archetypal English ''nonsense'' of Edward Lear. Behind the whimsy is an acute observer of love, death and the entire evolutionary continuum from plants to bugs to humans. Onstage, Mr. Hitchcock free-associates stories that can be as improbably touching as his songs. At Southpaw, tomorrow night at 7, admission is $15. At Maxwell's, Sunday night at 9, with Shearwater opening; admission is $15. PARELES INTERNATIONAL POP OVERTHROW FESTIVAL, Arlene Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1652, and Acme Underground, 9 Great Jones Street, (212) 677-6924. Love songs driven by electric guitars were synonymous with Top 40 pop in the days of the Beatles, and still hanging on more self-consciously in the 1970's with groups like the Raspberries. But gradually, power pop became the province of collectors, revivalists and songwriters who couldn't wait to get their hearts broken so they could come up with another song. The International Pop Overthrow Festival in Los Angeles has rallied power-pop bands regularly for years, and it has spread to England and the East Coast. It continues tonight at 8 at Arlene Grocery, with the Grip Weeds (at 10:15) and other bands associated with the Rainbow Quartz label. Then it moves to Acme Underground for shows tomorrow and Sunday afternoons at 1 and evenings at 7, with bills of eight bands each (including a set Sunday afternoon at 3:30 by the tuneful and hard-nosed Marianne Pillburys) and it concludes at Acme on Monday night with another eight bands. Admission to each show is $10; the full lineup is at www.internationalpopoverthrow.com/eastc.html. PARELES J-LIVE, VAST AIRE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A hip-hop show starring a couple of local cult favorites. J-Live is a hardcore formalist, known for his rigorously constructed rhymes: in one of his tracks, ''One for the Griot,'' the rapper tells a story and then doubles back twice to provide alternative endings. He is to be joined by Vast Aire, from the duo Cannibal Ox, known for dense, murky, half-speed rhymes that you don't hear so much as absorb. Tomorrow night at 11, with MC Double AB; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 at the door SANNEH * KAYHAN KALHOR, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Playing classical Persian music on the kemancheh, an upright fiddle, Kayhan Kalhor is a fiery improviser who moves from sighing, songful lines to fiercely percussive pizzicato fusillades and swirling arpeggios. Ali Akbar Moradi, who plays the tanbur (a three-stringed lute), shares the bill. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $28 and $35. PARELES MARCEL KHALIFE, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. The oud player and singer Marcel Khalife, from Lebanon, moves easily between traditional Arabic music and his own settings of contemporary poems; he has written a concerto for oud and orchestra and dipped into jazz. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25, $35 and $45. PARELES DAVID LINDLEY, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The guitarist David Lindley was once Jackson Browne's utility sideman. He went on to record albums of his own featuring his collection of cheap guitars, and has traveled the world soaking up string traditions, from Hawaii to Turkey, Ireland to Madagascar. Tonight at 8; admission is $23. PARELES LONG ISLAND REGGAE MUSIC FESTIVAL, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000. A lineup of longtime reggae stars includes Jimmy Cliff, Bunny Wailer, Maxi Priest, Luciano, Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt, Sly and Robbie, Half Pint, Tony Rebel and others, covering the spectrum from lovers' croons to righteous resistance. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $45 to $85. PARELES * MUDVILLE, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, below Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Mudville is a duo: Marilyn Carino sings about troubled longings and bleak surreal visions, while Ben Rubin surrounds her melancholy voice with brooding, minor-key tracks that start with electric piano and venture into smoky, ominous lounge territory, somewhere between Fiona Apple and Morcheeba. Tonight at 10:30, with Henry Shead at 9:30, Nikki Borodi at 8:30 and Jaymay and Ivan Sandomire at 7; admission is $8. PARELES NEVILLE BROTHERS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The Neville Brothers have been at the center of New Orleans funk since the 1950's. Art Neville, on keyboards, is a funk mastermind; Aaron Neville sings ballads with a voice of angelic purity and vulnerability. The Nevilles apply all their experience in syncopation to their own songs and, lately, cover songs like ''Ball of Confusion.'' Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $40. PARELES * OOIOO, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Yoshimi, the playful multi-instrumentalist who plays with the long-running Japanese free-rock group the Boredoms, also leads OOIOO, an all-female quartet known for shape-shifting, semi-improvised compositions that often sound both rigorous and delicate. The most recent OOIOO album is ''Kila Kila Kila'' (Thrill Jockey), a confounding but warmly enveloping disc that shows the group to be a (welcome) new sort of jam band, one content to concentrate on a single musical texture for minutes at a time, then suddenly switch directions with a series of woozy jump cuts. Tonight at 11, with Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, who is to be accompanied by Ikue Mori and Jim O'Rourke; tickets are $14. SANNEH PROJECT OBJECT, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Frank Zappa's music was never easy to play. It called for players who loved both basic three-chord rock and all the whizzing, swerving, whimsical complexities that Zappa could devise. Musicians are still willing to devote themselves to its wayward intricacies, and Project Object has been working its way through the Zappa repertory for years. Its guests include past members of Mr. Zappa's bands: the guitarist Ike Willis and the singer Napoleon Murphy Brock. Sunday night at 8, tickets are $18 in advance, $22 Sunday. PARELES THE RADIATORS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The second-line backbeat of New Orleans funk is the heartbeat of the Radiators, a rock band that has been together since the 1970's. As band members sing about woman trouble and other frustrations, the groove keeps people shimmying. Tonight at 8; admission is $25. PARELES THE STRAWBS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The Strawbs, led by David Cousins, were part of the 1970's wave of English traditional rock, setting their own takes on ancient legends to rich, modal melodies. They return minus the electric guitars. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow. PARELES * MATTHEW SWEET, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Power pop is a balance of yearning, melody and muscle, and Matthew Sweet likes his on the burly side. He shields his feelings behind noisy guitars, but he still reveals a tender heart. Tonight, doors open at 8 and Velvet Crush shares the bill; tickets are $25. PARELES DEREK TRUCKS, the Chance, 6 Crannel Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845) 471-1966 and Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. Joining a southern rock dynasty, the slide guitar player Derek Trucks splits his time between the Allman Brothers Band, which includes his uncle Butch Trucks on drums, and his own blues-rocking band, which constantly works the jam-band circuit. At the Chance tonight at 8:30; tickets are $20. At Spirit tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $25. PARELES * THE USED, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. In 2002, the members of this Utah band put together a fragile, ferocious self-titled debut, full of hair-trigger love songs that kept devolving into screaming chaos. Now comes ''In Love and Death'' (Reprise), an impressive follow-up -- weird and catchy and unexpectedly funny. ''Listening'' wraps a frustrated anti-love song around a screamed, kindergartenish refrain: ''I'm not listening!'' And it ends with ''I'm a Fake,'' during which the singer, Bert McCracken, frantically shuttles between voices and attitudes. ''Look at me, look at me now,'' he pleads. Then the raw-throated rejoinder: ''I'm a fake! I'm a fake! I'm a fake!'' Tonight at 6:45; tickets are $22. SANNEH WU-TANG CLAN, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900. A decade ago, Wu-Tang Clan was hip-hop's unstoppable vanguard alliance, encompassing brains, ferocity, comedy, romance, kung-fu trivia and all the ominous urban ambience that its producer and conceptualist, the RZA, could conjure. Uncounted solo albums later, the RZA, the GZA, Ghostface, Method Man, Raekown, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa and Ol' Dirty Bastard have reunited. Their past live shows always verged on anarchy, and there's no reason to expect anything different now. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 and $47.50. PARELES Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. MONTY ALEXANDER'S JAZZ PARTY, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Columbus Circle, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9800. Mr. Alexander, a jazz pianist originally from Jamaica, has often refitted reggae songs and steel-drum sounds for a jazz-trio context; it's breezy, amiable stuff, and he can summon good swing. His band for this weekend includes the remarkable drummer Herlin Riley, and Clark Terry, a trumpeter and fluegelhornist who is one of jazz's great soloists. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 o'clock set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables and $5 at the bar. BEN RATLIFF GATO BARBIERI, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. All gatos have a few lives, and Mr. Barbieri, the saxophonist, has had three: first as a free-jazz wailer in the early 1970's, then as the soloist on the celebrated ''Last Tango in Paris'' soundtrack and now as a smooth-jazz balladeer. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10, Sunday at 8:45 and 10 p.m.; covers charges, $32.50 tonight and Sunday, $35 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum all nights. RATLIFF * CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Here is jazz fusion, the real article. The overall sound may be dated, but Mr. Corea's Elektric Band -- which existed from the mid-80's to early 90's, and has recently been resurrected, in a different lineup -- can be fascinating to hear. In the amped-up clatter of 16th notes, there are differences among players. The saxophonist Eric Marienthal injects a kind of soul, in longer, more expressive notes. Mr. Corea generally changes his rhythmic orientation every couple of bars. And the guitarist Frank Gambale, the bassist Ric Fierabracci and the drummer Dave Weckl can play like stylish nail guns. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $45 and there is a $5 minimum. RATLIFF ELLERY ESKELIN-ANDREA PARKINS-JIM BLACK, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. The saxophonist's trio, with Andrea Parkins on accordion and samplers and Jim Black on drums, is now in its 10th year; it's a frisky group, fracturing Mr. Eskelin's blues-and-bop roots with jagged backdrops. Music begins Sunday night at 9:30; the cover charge is $10. RATLIFF BENNY GOLSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Golson, in his mid-70's, is an unlikely jazz hero: upbeat, fascinated with technique, a nonpurist who has spent equal time among the different aesthetic dispositions of East and West Coast jazz, a tinkerer who has written soul-jazz standards like ''Killer Joe'' as well as his own classical music. Above all, he is a first-class saxophone improviser, a Philadelphia colleague of John Coltrane going back to the mid-1940's whose own notions of phrasing and harmony have been deeply influenced by his friend's. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25. RATLIFF * 'JACK JOHNSON FESTIVAL,' Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. A new Ken Burns documentary produces a cross-marketed pileup of culture, and his latest, ''Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,'' is no exception. The full biography that drives it, written by Geoffrey C. Ward, is already in bookstores; Mr. Burns's film will be shown on PBS in January; and Blue Note records will release Wynton Marsalis's soundtrack to the film on Nov. 30. This weekend at Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center puts on an evening that's half film, half music. First Mr. Burns previews sections of the film; then Mr. Marsalis and his septet play sections of the soundtrack. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 to $150. RATLIFF * JOE LOVANO NONET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. A sock-to-the-gut band, with room for fun. It spans the last 50 years of jazz, with new arrangements of bebop-era tunes, some Coltrane writ large and Mr. Lovano's playful, sometimes calculatedly abstract, up-to-date originals. There are great players here representing the bricks and mortar of New York's jazz-club scene, including the saxophonists Steve Slagle, Ralph Lalama and George Garzone, and the drummer Lewis Nash; they create a great ruckus and heft, and leave you feeling that jazz is doing all right, thanks very much. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; the cover charge is $30. RATLIFF * DJANGO REINHARDT FESTIVAL, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. An annual event, and a surprisingly potent one. Django Reinhardt's slashing swing rhythm and overpowering sense of romantic melody makes imitation a worthwhile goal. This year's supplicants to the altar include the French guitarists Dorado Schmitt and Mayo Hubert, as well as the Basily Gypsy Band, from the Netherlands, and two other Dutch musicians, the pianist Peter Beets and guitarist Martin Limberger. Sitting in as guests are Gil Goldstein, on accordion, tonight, and Dave Samuels on vibraphone on Sunday. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 11; cover charge, $35 tonight and tomorrow night, $30 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all nights. RATLIFF JALEEL SHAW QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. A young alto saxophonist who has proved himself around New York recently; his band now includes Robert Glasper, a pianist of great promise, the similarly impressive guitarist Lage Lund, and the drummer Greg Hutchinson. Sets are tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members. RATLIFF HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID, Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, Manhattan, (212) 594-7149. Mr. Threadgill's newest band plays pieces shorter than his works in recent years, and an oud changes the texture; otherwise, Zooid is a refinement of the sweet-and-sour, jazz-tango-Balkan-funk matrix (always with a tuba) that Mr. Threadgill, one of our great composers, refined through the 90's. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20. RATLIFF THREE GUITARS: LARRY CORYELL, JOHN ABERCROMBIE, BADI ASSAD, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. It's Larry Coryell and John Abercrombie -- not unlikely colleagues -- as well as the Brazilian guitarist and singer Badi Assad; together they play sets that flicker between classical music, relaxed jazz and Brazilian song. Sets tonight through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. RATLIFF MICHAEL WEISS TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. Michael Weiss, a longtime member of the saxophonist Johnny Griffin's band as well as a leader in his own right, has the charging rhythms of bebop playing under his fingers, and he can focus the intensity in a tune as well as any pianist in the jazz mainstream. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; the cover charge is $10. RATLIFF Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. KLEA BLACKHURST, Opia, 130 East 57th Street, (212) 688-3939. ''For me, all musical comedy roads lead to Ethel Merman,'' declares Klea Blackhurst late in her show, ''Autumn in New York: Vernon Duke's Broadway.'' This singer from Salt Lake City makes good on that comparison the moment she opens her mouth and unleashes a bright, brassy rallying cry that is the vocal equivalent of strong home-brewed coffee without sugar or cream. She delivers an upbeat musical biography of the composer of ''April in Paris,'' ''Autumn in New York'' and ''I Can't Get Started,'' buttressed by the light swing arrangements of the Pocket Change Trio (Michael Rice on piano, Ray Kilday on bass and David Strauss on guitar and banjo). Tonight and Sunday night at 7 and tomorrow night at 9. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95. HOLDEN * PAULA WEST AND THE ERIC REED TRIO, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. This San Francisco jazz singer has always relished transgressing stylistic conventions. Her new show includes a folk-jazz-rap version of Bob Dylan's ''Subterranean Homesick Blues,'' which she turns into a slurred mouthful of pure jazz rhythm. Her mischievous streak also asserts itself in slyly updated versions of Cole Porter's ''At Long Last Love'' and ''Anything Goes,'' that mention phenomena like nonfat creamer, the Hilton sisters and reality television. Her thoughtful renditions of ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Black and Blue'' find her emerging as a heavyweight balladeer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows. HOLDEN Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty op\u00e9ra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival, which appears tonight for the last time this season: Irina Mishura takes on Carmen; and Richard Leech sings Don Jos\u00e9. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Mica\u00ebla, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. Paul Nadler conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. ANNE MIDGETTE 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' Opera's favorite double bill has returned in the Metropolitan Opera's venerable productions of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.'' Go not for a famous cast but for Mascagni's lightning-bolt blood and guts and Leoncavallo's equally sinister exercise in revenge and murder. Dennis Russell Davies conducts both operas. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. BERNARD HOLLAND 'CINDERELLA' Opera meets Broadway in more ways than one at City Opera this week. The company is giving itself over entirely to 13 consecutive productions of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical (not, admittedly, one of the duo's greatest hits, but enjoyable nonetheless) with a starry cast of a decidedly nonoperatic bent. Sarah Uriarte Berry, who's done ''Beauty and the Beast'' on the Great White Way, takes the title role, but more than likely two other contenders will be duking out who's to steal the show: the cross-dressing John (Lypsinka) Epperson as the Stepmother and the great Eartha Kitt as the Fairy Godmother. Gerald Steichen conducts. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Remaining tickets: $27 to $105 tonight, $32 to $115 tomorrow and Sunday. MIDGETTE 'I VESPRI SICILIANI' The convoluted story and clunky libretto to Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani'' has probably kept this mature and stirring opera from gaining repertory status. So it's good to have this neglected and important work back at the Met after 22 years, a revival of John Dexter's grimly abstract 1974 production. In the impassioned and stylish performance by the conductor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaslin and a strong cast, ''I Vespri Siciliani'' emerges as a musically distinguished opera that, with its French inflections, anticipates Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlos.'' Don't fret if the story, based on the 1282 uprising and massacre by the people of Palermo, Sicily, against their hated French occupiers, seems implausible. Just let yourself get swept away by the music and relish the work of the compelling soprano Sondra Radvanovsky, the husky-voiced (and husky-framed) tenor Francisco Casanova, the elegant baritone Leo Nucci and the stentorian bass Samuel Ramey. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music BARGEMUSIC One of the best places to hear chamber music in New York is a converted barge docked in Brooklyn right next to the Brooklyn Bridge. Founded in 1977 and still run by the grandmotherly violinist Olga Bloom, Bargemusic presents concerts in a wonderfully intimate wood-paneled room with thrilling views of lower Manhattan and excellent acoustics. Tonight the cellist Leonid Gorochov and the pianist Niklas Sivelov play works by Stravinsky, Schnittke, Haydn and the ever-popular ''Arpeggione'' Sonata by Schubert. Tomorrow evening and Sunday afternoon these two players will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov, who is also Bargemusic's adventurous artistic director, for a program of music by Beethoven for piano trio, including the deceptively noble but actually radical Trio in E-flat (Op. 70, No. 2). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, $25 for students. TOMMASINI BELCEA QUARTET This young string quartet, founded a decade ago in London, proved impressive in its New York debut as part of Carnegie Hall's Distinctive Debuts series in 2000. Now it expands on that success in a pair of concerts. Tomorrow night it plays one of the same works, Britten's Quartet No. 3; a different Haydn quartet; and Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 4. On Sunday it plays a shorter program: Wolf's ''Italian Serenade'' and Beethoven's Opus 132. Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; tickets $35. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; tickets $20. JAMES R. OESTREICH CHAMPAGNE CLASSICAL CONCERTS In the 1920's, it was not unusual for swanky hotels or restaurants to present classical music concerts, often with several well-known performers each contributing short sets. The Rainbow Room is hoping to revive that quaint tradition, or at least, a hint of it, with a series of Sunday afternoon piano recitals by young, accomplished players. Each recital lasts about 75 minutes, with no intermission, and the somewhat hefty ticket price ($75) includes a drink before the performance and dessert after it. The musical fare is light (if sometimes virtuosic), in keeping with the setting and format. This week the soloist is Richard Dowling, who is devoting his program to ragtime works by Scott Joplin, Zez Confrey, Joseph F. Lamb and others. Gershwin favorites round out the recital. Sunday at 5, the Rainbow Room, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor, (212) 632-5000. Tickets: $75. ALLAN KOZINN EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Frederick Renz and his enterprising ensemble have become deft arrangers of thematic programs, although sometimes an asterisk or two is required to explain programmatic loopholes. This week's program is called ''Renaissance Women,'' which might lead a listener to expect a full program of works by the comparatively few female composers whose works have been discovered and identified. There is, after all, more than enough of it to sustain a full program. As it turns out, four women are represented, including the extraordinary Barbara Strozzi, and three composers who were also nuns, Lucretia Vizzana, Suor Maria Xaveria Perucona and Chiara Margarita Cozzolani. There is also, however, lots of music by men. In some cases, the work is about a woman, most notably the Virgin Mary, as in a Palestrina setting of Salve Regina and a pair of devotional motets by P. de la Farge and Laurus Pativinus Mantuae. Other works, including a group of chansons by Crecquillon, are based on secular texts written from a woman's perspective. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330. Tickets: $35. KOZINN PAUL GROVES. This Louisiana-born tenor is best known to New Yorkers for his regular work at the Metropolitan Opera since his 1992 debut. James Levine has taken a special interest in his career. When Mr. Groves made his 1996 New York recital debut in Lincoln Center's Art of the Song series, Mr. Levine was his accompanist. Mr. Groves will sing again in that series on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, a recital accompanied by the Bosnian-born pianist Pedja Muzijevic, and others. Their program offers works by Faur\u00e9, Liszt and Rachmaninoff. But of special interest will be Britten's seldom-heard and challenging Canticle III ''Still Falls the Rain -- the Raids, 1940, Night and Dawn,'' and also the composer's ''Winter Words,'' a moody and affecting song cycle that sets eight poems by Thomas Hardy. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $48. TOMMASINI JUILLIARD SCHOOL BAROQUE CONCERT Until recent years, this might have seemed an oxymoron. The once-staid Juilliard School was slow to come to terms with the early-music movement. But now it has a Baroque specialist, the harpsichordist Lionel Party, on its faculty, and it has taken to showing off its wares in this line. Here Mr. Party leads performances of Bach's Cantata No. 51, ''Jauchzet Gott in Allen Landen,'' Handel's ''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' and other pieces. Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Free, but tickets are required. OESTREICH * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC You could say the Philharmonic is crossing the Finnish line. The wonderful soprano Karita Mattila is making her New York Philharmonic debut this week in a set of songs by one of today's best composers, Kaija Saariaho, written expressly for her. The fine young conductor Sakari Oramo will lead the orchestra for the second time. The program includes the New York premiere of Sibelius's tone poem ''The Bard.'' The only non-Finnish element on the program, in fact, is Tchaikovsky's ''Manfred'' Symphony. In short, there's nothing not to like; all indications point to a really worthwhile evening. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90. MIDGETTE ORCHESTRA 2001 This chamber orchestra, directed by James Freeman, was founded in 1988 to perform contemporary music. It has built a strong following in Philadelphia, where it is based, and it visits New York periodically as well. Mr. Freeman and company will be here on Sunday to perform two song cycles by George Crumb, ''The River of Life'' and ''A Journey Beyond Time.'' Both composed in 2003, the cycles are the first two books in Mr. Crumb's four-volume ''American Songbook.'' These two volumes are based on spirituals (among them, ''Shall We Gather at the River,'' ''Deep River'' and ''Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child''), and they are to be sung here by the sopranos for whom they were written: Ann Crumb, the composer's daughter, will sing ''The River of Life,'' and Barbara Ann Martin, who has long been closely associated with Mr. Crumb's music, will sing ''A Journey Beyond Time.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights. (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $25 to $30. KOZINN POMERIUM This magnificent early-music choir, founded in 1972 and led by Alexander Blachly, consistently offers thoughtful and enlightening programs. Mr. Blachly is devoting the group's program this time to the music of Ockeghem, one of the great 15th-century Flemish composers, and a pivotal figure: he studied with Dufay and probably Binchois, and taught Josquin. The program includes three of Ockeghem's Masses, including his two best-known settings, the Missa L'Homme Arm\u00e9 and the Missa Prolationum. The Missa au Travail Suis, an Ave Maria setting and a lamentation on the death of Binchois round out the program. Tomorrow night at 7:30, the Great Hall at Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 62+. KOZINN TRIO MEDIAEVAL Iraq wasn't the only thing ''handed over'' last summer. What's more, the handover of hegemony between female vocal groups in the not always placid world of early music was orderly. Anonymous 4 disbanded after last season and a New York farewell appearance at Corpus Christi Church, where it had performed for years. Now the Oslo-based Trio Mediaeval, which made its New York debut last season, takes over in the church's invaluable series Music Before 1800, performing the 13th-century ''Messe de Tournai'' and other works. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $40 and $25; $35 and $20 for students and 62+. OESTREICH Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. IVY BALDWIN The wildly imaginative Ms. Baldwin, a product of the North Carolina School of the Arts and New York University's Tisch School, has conjured up a scarily nutty world in her new ''Now Leaving Vanderville.'' Citizens go to war only on Mondays. (Well, that doesn't sound too bad.) They also stuff ducks for a living, however, as they wait patiently to be annihilated every week. All this is set to a score of songs by Kurt Weill, performed live by Franz Nicolay and Carrie Lewis. Also on the program is ''la table,'' a duet for snobs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Prince and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org. Tickets: $10 and $15. JENNIFER DUNNING * BLAKTINO PERFORMANCE SERIES Things are getting complicated in the world of ethnic nomenclature. This series, for instance, celebrates art by black, Latino and ''Blatino'' artists in two programs by Bronx-based companies this weekend. Tonight, Kim Vasquez's Kush troupe will perform West Indian dance that ends with a drum-and-dance jam, followed by Pedro Raposo's all-female Caracol troupe, which performs Afro-Dominican dance. Tomorrow the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater will present an evening of new and recent modern-dance pieces, set to scores that include music by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, created by Mr. Aviles, a Bill T. Jones alumnus whose choreographic voice is distinctively brash, sweet-tempered and thoughtful. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, BAAD! (the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance), 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, South Bronx, (718) 842-5223. Tickets: $15. DUNNING DELFOS DANZA CONTEMPORANEA A dance troupe from Mexico that takes its name from the Delphic oracle of Greece makes its New York debut in choreography that combines great physicality with sensual and poetic imagery. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $34. JACK ANDERSON * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, of which Mr. Dennis is a co-founder. His film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters who include Mark Russell, for many years the theater's director and animating spirit. Sunday at 2 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5. DUNNING 'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m., Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85. DUNNING RENNIE HARRIS'S LEGENDS OF HIP-HOP Rennie Harris has created a fast-paced journey through hip-hop history in which he honors the pioneers of hip-hop and presents a panorama of hip-hop styles, all in only 50 minutes. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 12 and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Theater District, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30. ANDERSON HOI POLLOI Sara Sweet Rabidoux, the company choreographer, describes her work as deliberately awkward and creepily dear, borrowing techniques from film and fiction writing that include internal dialogues and dream sequences. Joining this modern-dance troupe will be the singer Heloise and the Savoir Faire Dancers. ''Think Blondie meets Fraggle Rock,'' Ms. Rabidoux comments. Nice of her to warn us. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Joyce SoHo Theater, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $10; $8 for students and 65+. DUNNING RISA JAROSLOW AND DANCERS In her ''Whole Sky,'' Risa Jaroslow combines her dancers with members of the community to affirm her fascination with the ways in which people can interact in society. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20. (Related review, Page 3.) ANDERSON BARBARA MAHLER AND MEG WOLFE Barbara Mahler's ''Fragments'' is based on solos for herself. But some of her movements also filter into the choreography performed by Amy Kail and Vicky Shick. In Meg Wolfe's ''Stormy Days With Josephine,'' past and present collide on a Los Angeles freeway. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15. ANDERSON 'NEW DANCES AT JUILLIARD EDITION 2004' This free program consists of dances by four choreographers -- Robert Battle, Janis Brenner, Ronald K. Brown and Susan Marshall -- each of whom worked with a single class of young Juilliard dancers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m., Juilliard Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 799-5000. DUNNING * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7; Sunday at 3 p.m., S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15. DUNNING VENCL DANCE TRIO Susan Vencl performed with choreographers like Albert Reid and Elaine Shipman before embarking on her own career of making dances. She characterizes her style as making architectural use of repeated and interlocking patterns and developing from close attention to the musical scores, here by Iannis Xenakis, Morton Feldman and Toshio Hosokawa. Tonight at 9; tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15. DUNNING Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+. HOLLAND COTTER * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold B\u00f6cklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4. GRACE GLUECK 'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Aveune, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. Cut mostly from thin slabs of marble or wood, the cleverly joined parts are notched to fit into each other without benefit of glue, nails or other fixatives. They form a quintessentially Noguchi synthesis of the human and totemic. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. A small gallery displays the quirky abstract sculptures he called ''Lunars'' that, rigged out with light bulbs in odd places, made lamps of a fine, goofy sci-fi quality that must have seemed off the wall in 1943. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Overall, a well-planned presentation that moves engrossingly along. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, a mother-of-pearl cup in the shape of a parrot, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. KIMMELMAN 'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. ''The Skater (William Grant),'' done in 1782, is a stunning full-length figure of an acquaintance from Stuart's London days performing a graceful maneuver on the ice. It is, far and beyond being a portrait, a haunting work whose liberating air seems to extol the individual as master of his fate. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10. SMITH Galleries: Uptown 'BOB THE ROMAN: HEROIC ANTIQUITY AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF ROBERT ADAM,' Gallery of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street, (212) 472-1500, through Dec. 4. Not for nothing did the Scotsman Robert Adam (1728-1792) playfully restyle himself ''Bob the Roman'' after soaking up the Eternal City on his youthful grand tour of Europe. Nearly everything he turned his hand to later as the celebrated architect, designer and interior decorator of late 18th-century England evoked the classical spirit of his beloved Rome. This show of more than 80 drawings made in the Adam office (Robert's brother, James, was his partner) is an enlightening introduction to the Adam brothers' scope. The works range from a nine-foot-long view of the facade of an intricate fantasy palace to numerous plans and proposals for town houses, villas and castles, along with their ornamentation, many of which actually got built. GLUECK BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead. KEN JOHNSON ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Alfred Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world whose studio was a center of happenings and other events besides painting. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points. GLUECK * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism. SMITH 'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Sol\u00f3rzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape painted in orange and white on the wall; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jos\u00e9 D\u00e1vila. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street SAM CADY: 'MAINE, NEW PAINTINGS,' Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669, through Nov. 24. The state of Maine may have inspired more artists than any other in the Union, and here's another devoted example. In this group of canvases, closely tailored to fit the subjects, Mr. Cady celebrates the coastal village he lives in, where boats are built, fish are caught and seagulls clamor. His chef d'oeuvre, ''Morning Mirage, Jones Garden,'' depicts a long, narrow, horizontal stripe of shore eight feet long by a little over three inches wide called ''Morning Mirage, Jones Garden.'' No sky and no water are shown, but tiny islands appear at the top of the construction, giving the effect of a very distant view from a boat out in the water. Other ingenuities include cut-outs in the shape of a small dory; the hulls of a couple of boats being built, and a snow-covered dock from a walk-on perspective. But the painting is a little too slick to be all that down-homey. GLUECK WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 3. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown. COTTER Galleries: Chelsea SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet to be published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog. JOHNSON RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies. JOHNSON NICKY NODJOUMI: 'PRIVATE AGENDA,' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, through Nov. 24. Born in Iran in 1942, Mr. Nodjoumi moved to New York in the 80's to escape censorship by the new fundamentalist government. With a skillful painterly touch and in muted colors he creates darkly humorous, poetically haunting political allegories like the image of the United States president and vice president with heads bowed in prayer carrying on their backs, respectively, a giant heart and a bundle of dried shrubbery. JOHNSON 'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Nov. 21. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the president's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the President humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq. JOHNSON Other Galleries SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment. JOHNSON 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting. JOHNSON Last Chance 'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through tomorrow. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tomorrow and Saturday, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3. JOHNSON GORDON COSTER, Keith de Lellis, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482, through today. This retrospective exhibition of more than 60 photographs dating from 1925 to 1950 documents the career of a versatile and skillful photojournalist. It includes semi-abstract still-lifes and nudes, documentary pictures of inner-city life and labor and civil rights strife and pictures of idyllic family scenes made for magazine ads that are, in some ways, among the show's most provocative images. JOHNSON * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through tomorrow. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses. SMITH DONALD JUDD/ROBERT MANGOLD, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, through tomorrow. The pairing of the paintings and sculptures of these major Minimalist artists is a no-brainer, especially since both are represented by this gallery. But it looks surprisingly fresh and is beautifully installed. Each artist works with simple volumes of space, whether actual or illusionistic, that are divided and measured with the addition of repeating related elements. In Mr. Mangold's work two or three lines undulate or curve from top to across the lightly gridded monochrome color-fields of his tall ''Column'' paintings. The divisions of Mr. Judd's boxed or columnar volumes of space proceed with perpendicular planes or repeating, sometimes sub-divided units. SMITH JEFF LADOUCEUR: 'SCHMO,' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-1088, through tomorrow. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopuses and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching. JOHNSON KURT LIGHTNER: 'A VIEW ALMOST PICTURESQUE,' Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937, through tomorrow. A single huge and enthralling landscape occupies Clementine's main gallery. Measuring 12 by 22 feet, it presents a life-size, magically vivid squirrel's eye view into a forest. Part Pre-Raphaelite, part Charles Burchfield and part Walt Disney, it was made by gluing thousands of individual images of plants, trees, stones and ferns -- each painted in acrylic ink on Mylar -- onto big paper panels. JOHNSON TOMOKO SAWADA: 'COSTUME,' Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1224, through tomorrow. In the tradition of Claude Cahun, Ana Mendieta and Cindy Sherman, the Japanese artist Tomoko Sawada puts female identity through its paces, but without limiting her role-playing to the studio. She enters the real world, to pose as a dentist, policewoman, secretary, nun or tea-house hostess in what might be called their natural habitats. What's most interesting is the way Ms. Sawada adjusts her facial expression and body language to each persona and, moreover, to our preconceptions about the women's social status and psychological profile. The images need one another to be most effective, but in nearly every case, Ms. Sawada's performance is more than skin-deep, which is why it unsettles. SMITH DONALD SULTAN: 'NEW POPPY PAINTINGS,' Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through tomorrow. Mr. Sultan builds his massive pictures of flat, brightly colored poppy blossoms on velvety black fields out of industrial strength materials: plywood, Masonite, linoleum, tar and enamel paint. Far from heavy-handed or over-bearing, however, his works exude a suave and seductive blend of visual and tactile sensuousness. JOHNSON VICTOR VASARELY: 'BLACK AND WHITE PAINTINGS FROM THE 1950'S,' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774, through tomorrow. This small but surprisingly interesting sideshow presents just six black-and-white paintings dating from 1952 to 1962. This Hungarian-born painter, who lived from 1906 to 1997, came to be thought of as a visual cheap trickster, but the optically tantalizing compositions of stripes, grid patterns and patterns like bar codes on view here have a fine, concentrated rigor.

Get Me Gene Hackman For the past few years, Hollywood's weekend box-office tallies have come to represent a tidy bit of wisdom about American culture -- cold, bare numbers relayed around the world every Monday morning that tell us which stories and which celebrities are resonating with the moviegoing public. There is, however, another set of Hollywood statistics of enormous significance, and Tuesday is their day. How important are these numbers? Every Tuesday at lunchtime, Mike Dunn and Peter Staddon, the president and executive vice president, respectively, of 20th Century Fox's home-entertainment division, take the elevator from ther 25th-floor offices at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles down to their cars in the underground parking garage and from there drive out into the noontime traffic on their way to Best Buy, Target, Costco and Wal-Mart. Tuesday is the day new DVD's are released, the day Dunn gets a sense of whether the discs that his team has worked on for months -- or sometimes years -- will sell as well as planned. So the Fox executives wander the aisles of the big retailers. They eavesdrop. They size up the clientele. They take note of what's moving through the cash registers. Tuesday, not Monday, is their day of reckoning. And in many ways, the same is true for their parent company as well. From about 2002 on, the larger stakes in Hollywood -- the revenue that enables studios to finance blockbusters and to pay Brad Pitt and to keep the lights on -- have come to ride mostly on those little silver discs that go on sale four or five months after a theatrical release. This year, for instance, 63 percent of studio feature-film revenues in the United States will come from movies sold to retail stores; actual box office will generate only 21 percent.

Theater Broadway + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95. BEN BRANTLEY + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. As she relates in ''The Good Body,'' ''I said the word vagina vagina vagina a million times. I thought I was home free. I had finally come to like my vagina. Until one day I realized the self-hatred had just crept up into my stomach.'' Like ''Vagina Monologues,'' ''The Good Body'' aims to uplift and to empower as it entertains. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. Reaching for a breadstick, she commendably argues, should trigger neither a crisis of conscience nor a spasm of shame. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish production, directed by Peter Askin, can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply. Where ''Vagina Monologues'' broke new ground, ''Good Body'' mostly sticks to well-trodden pathways (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance. CHARLES ISHERWOOD + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25. ISHERWOOD + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revial of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother,'' directed by Michael Mayer. Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage, folding towels, making cocoa: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25. BRANTLEY * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production, directed with brisk straightforwardness by Scott Ellis. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'FIVE BY TENN' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. The director Michael Kahn employs an actor portraying Williams himself to introduce the plays, a faintly apologetic gesture. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere, the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. In ''The Fat Man's Wife,'' from 1938, Williams is trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance. ISHERWOOD 'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25. BRANTLEY *+ 'GUANT\u00c1NAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. BRANTLEY 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays. ISHERWOOD 'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD *+ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25. ISHERWOOD + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 505-0700. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. Now Playing 'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. With Mr. Brosnan, the line between sly and stony has always been precarious. Here, the most reliable James Bond since Sean Connery seems so buttoned-up and bored he can't even be bothered to raise an eyebrow. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp. STEPHEN HOLDEN 'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies (see, at your peril, the oeuvre of the filmmaker James Toback), but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges. MANOHLA DARGIS 'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A. O. SCOTT 'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re wrote many scripts for Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. As the mood shifts ingeniously from gothic to romance to comedy of manners, her emotions play in counterpoint, flickering from light-heartedness to uncertainty to full-eyed sorrow. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can. SCOTT 'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? At the screening a lot of women were cackling lustily every time the camera zoomed in on Bridget's bulbous posterior, which of course looks much like the posterior of most women who don't live for Pilates and in Beverly Hills. Ms. Kidron took obvious delight in this unhappy view, too. She either really disliked her star or thinks humiliating other women is great sport. Whatever the case, you have to wonder why all these women (you go, sister!) relish the spectacle of a normally well-coiffed, highly paid Academy Award-winning actress, who dates rock stars no less, looking so bad. Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, as plush and appealing as an Eiderdown comforter, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck. Doesn't the poor thing read fashion magazines or go shopping in London's boutiques and groovy outdoor markets? Doesn't she wash her hair? DARGIS 'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Born in Scotland in 1860, Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' has been revisited numerous times, as in the splendid 1952 Disney animation, and has become an emblem for everlasting youth, both healthy and less so. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. Based on the play by Allan Knee, ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan,'' the film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children and the two adult actors exchange suitably noble looks even when Ms. Winslet's d\u00e9colletage threatens to play peek-a-boo. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote. DARGIS 'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat going meo-o-o-ow. DARGIS * 'I HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, Mr. Russell says, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope. DARGIS * 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes try to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced them into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Anything but dull and ordinary, this computer-animated feature has a clean and vibrant visual style and is organized around a strong, fascinating idea. Mr. Bird (''The Iron Giant'') uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world where ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology and trades in its subtlety for noise and over-familiar thrills. SCOTT * 'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost na\u00efve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight. Crisp performances by Ms. Linney, as Kinsey's wife, and Mr. Sarsgaard, as his first research assistant bring the complexities of Kinsey's life into sharp relief. SCOTT 'LA PETITE LILI' Starring Nicole Garcia and Ludivine Sagnier. Directed by Claude Miller (not rated, 104 minutes; in French, with subtitles). In dragging ''The Seagull'' into the age of cellphones, digital video and hip-hop, this ingeniously freewheeling adaptation of Chekhov's 1895 play stirs up a fascinating and contradictory mixture of the eternal and the transitory. But there are hurdles that ''La Petite Lili'' cannot overcome. Abridged and abbreviated, Chekhov's leisurely philosophic reflections evoke a musty aroma of pressed flowers in a scrapbook that's out of tune with the times. The rush to abridge leaves little room for what's left to seep into your bones. In the revelatory final act, many of the original characters converge on a movie set to recreate the events we have already seen. The movie within a movie is a small coup de cin\u00e9ma. HOLDEN * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'THE POLAR EXPRESS' With the voices of Tom Hanks and Michael Jeter. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (G, 97 minutes). Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, this new animated feature has received attention for the advanced technology employed to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ''Polar Express'' Mr. Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five different animated characters. It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound, with interiors that look like a munitions factory and facades that seem conceived along the same oppressive lines as Coketown, the red-brick town of ''machinery and tall chimneys'' in Dickens's ''Hard Times.'' Tots surely won't recognize that Santa's big entrance in front of the throngs of frenzied elves and awestruck children directly evokes, however unconsciously, one of Hitler's Nuremberg rally entrances in Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will.'' But their parents may marvel that when Santa's big red sack of toys is hoisted from factory floor to sleigh it resembles nothing so much as an airborne scrotum. DARGIS * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out. SCOTT 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BADLY DRAWN BOY, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. Self-editing is not among the stage skills of Damon Gough, or Badly Drawn Boy, whose quiet, smoky burr makes his albums sound casually intimate. His live shows tend to be long, rambling affairs, as he plays whatever songs come to mind -- his own or other people's -- until the effect of his best material is almost completely diluted. Tomorrow night at 8, with Adem opening; tickets are $25 and $30. JON PARELES * JANE BIRKIN, Skirball Center, 566 LaGuardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484. Jane Birkin was the sweet-voiced counterpoint -- and the longtime lover -- of Serge Gainsbourg, France's growling, chain-smoking, beloved bad-boy songwriter. Her tribute to him is called ''Arabesque,'' and with musicians from North Africa, it brings touches of Gypsy and Arabic modes to Gainsbourg's melancholy songs about the endless mismatches of love and lust, the ravages of time and the sadness that follows bliss. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $40. PARELES DAMON AND NAOMI/JIM O'ROURKE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Damon and Naomi used to be in Galaxie 500, and on their own they have held onto the old group's hushed tone and searching simplicity; their group includes Kurihara from the Japanese band Ghost. The guitarist Jim O'Rourke, now a member of Sonic Youth, has been a producer and collaborator with Wilco, Tortoise and others putting a surreal streak into their music. Tonight at 8, with Nmperign opening; admission is $10. PARELES * ANI DIFRANCO/TOSHI REAGON, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Ani DiFranco's articulate, uninhibited songs and poems are about staying true to her complicated self: feisty and vulnerable, polysexual, uncompromising and politically engaged but never humorless. She can strum a guitar and sling words at hyperspeed or swerve toward jazz and funk; for this tour, she's accompanied by Todd Sickafoose on upright bass. In business (she runs her own label, Righteous Babe Records) as in her music, she's as independent as they come. Toshi Reagon, opening the show, also sings about love and politics, with a voice steeped in the blues. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $43. PARELES MINNIE DRIVER/PETER HIMMELMAN, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 or (212) 260-4700. Yes, it's the actress, but she was singing before her movie career took off. On her new album, ''Everything I've Got in My Pocket'' (Zoe), she places herself somewhere between Dido and Natalie Merchant. Peter Himmelman's folk-rock songs can be wry or painfully earnest; they're rescued by clear-cut melodies and by stage banter that shows he doesn't always take himself as seriously as his songs' narrators do. Sunday night at 8:30, with Rusty Truck opening; tickets are $15. PARELES * EL GRAN COMBO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 239-2672. El Gran Combo was formed in 1962 and has been consistently on the Latin charts ever since. By now, it's an institution, still singing about matters close to the heart of Puerto Ricans on the island and far away. Tomorrow night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25. PARELES THE FEMM NAMELESS/WUNMI, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000. A double bill of transplanted Nigerian music. The Femm Nameless is a band of women that plays Afrobeat, the burly, horn-driven funk invented by Fela Kuti. Wunmi, a singer and dancer who was born in Nigeria, has brought an African touch to the dance-floor hybrids of Soul II Soul and Masters at Work. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15. PARELES EMM GRYNER, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Emm Gryner is a Canadian songwriter along the lines of Sarah McLachlan, letting love sweep her away as her melodies crest. Tonight at 7, with Holly Palmer opening; admission is $12. PARELES RICHIE HAVENS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Times Square, (212) 997-4144. An unswerving 1960's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. Tonight at 8, with Ra\u00fal Midon opening; tickets are $30. PARELES * THE HIVES, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111. The Hives, a sharp retro-rock band from Sweden, raise expectations so high that no one blames them for falling short. How could their new album, ''Tyrannosaurus Hives'' (Interscope), possibly be as great as the lead single, ''Walk Idiot Walk,'' which throws sneering insults (''See the idiot walk! See the idiot talk!'') on top of a thin, wild guitar riff? How could the supremely natty members possibly sound as cool as they look? Tomorrow and Sunday night at 7:30; tickets are $20. KELEFA SANNEH JACK OFFICERS, Lit, 93 Second Avenue, near Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987. Uh-oh. Gibby Haynes, leader of the once-infamous Butthole Surfers, comes to one of the city's most cheerfully seedy hipster bars to revive the Jack Officers, his proto-electronica side project. Whatever happens, it's sure to be a mess -- with luck an entertaining one. Tomorrow night at 9, with Jesse Diamond and the 1,000, Swiss Auto Club and Dream Bitches; admission is $7. SANNEH MASON JENNINGS, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Folk-rock from a songwriter in the John Mayer and Dave Mason mold, sometimes quiet and plaintive, sometimes working up to jam-band peaks. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10:30, with Jesse Harris (tonight at 9:30) or Cerys Matthews (tomorrow night at 9:30), and Haley Bonar both nights at 8:30; admission is $15. PARELES TOM JONES, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Welsh pop singer Tom Jones learned a lot from American blues and soul, and he seems as amused as anyone by his long-established image as a sex symbol; after all, he did sing Prince's ''Kiss'' with the Art of Noise. Whether or not anyone hurls lingerie during this concert, he's still got lungpower and a long string of hits to exercise it. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $65. PARELES EROL JOSUE, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. A Haitian songwriter who is also a voodoo priest, or houngan, Erol Josue leads a band, Regleman, that is rooted in voodoo rhythms but also includes the rambunctious jazz trombonist Roswell Rudd. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $20. PARELES STEVE KIMOCK BAND, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 or (212) 260-4700. Steve Kimock is a Jerry Garcia disciple who jams with liquid guitar solos that can be thoughtfully reticent or jazzy and light-fingered. He has played with the elite of the Grateful Dead diaspora, including the Other Ones, Phil Lesh and Friends and Bruce Hornsby. His band leans toward jazz-rock. Tomorrow, two sets beginning at 10 p.m.; tickets are $25. PARELES IGOR KRUTOI GALA CONCERT, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan,(212) 465-6741. One of Russia's most beloved songwriters, Igor Krutoi, will be joined by more than a dozen of his colleagues, including Valery Leontiev, Verka Serduchka, Raymond Pauls, Maria Rasputina, Igor Nikolaev and Laima Vaikule. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $39.50 to $504.50. PARELES * LITTLE FEAT, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Times Square, (212) 997-4144. In the 1970's, Little Feat merged the South and Southern California, spinning together blues and country, gospel and funk with some surreal Hollywood twists. The death in 1979 of its founder and conceptualizer, Lowell George, broke the band up for nearly a decade, but the other members regrouped in 1988. They have added an old friend, the guitarist Fred Tackett, and a female lead singer, Shaun Murphy, and are wrapping up a tour with these shows. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $25.50 in advance, $30 tomorrow. PARELES MARACATU NEW YORK, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The maracatu beat from Recife has driven carnival music and the funk of innovators like Chico Science. Jorge Martins, a percussionist from Recife, leads Maracatu New York. On Sunday night, there will be a film about the roots of maracatu at 7:30, followed by the band at 8; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 on Sunday. PARELES * EMELINE MICHEL, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. Emeline Michel is one of Haiti's most important singers, musically buoyant and socially engaged. Her sets are like tours of her country, as she draws on local styles from across the island, and her voice can be sweetly sensual or almost operatic as she soars above the beat. Tonight at 11, she shares the bill with Mozayik; admission is $22. (Related article, Page 3.) PARELES * ALI AKBAR MORADI, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Ali Akbar Moradi is a Kurdish musician from Iran who is a master of the tanbur, a three-stringed lute used for spiritual music. He will be playing the meditative improvisations of sacred music associated with the Yarsan people of western Iran, who follow a mystical faith associated with Sufism. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $30, or $26 for World Music Institute members and $15 for students. PARELES PALLADIUM REUNION, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 255-4223. Nightclub culture often doesn't leave behind a trail of archival material -- often, what happens between midnight and morning on a crowded dance floor stays there. This nostalgic dance party gives dance-music veterans a chance to remember the exuberant (sometimes sordid) spirit of the Palladium, a downtown institution that was eventually swallowed up by another downtown institution: New York University. Charlie Casanova, Merritt & Big Ben are the DJ's, to be joined by Romeo Romeo on the microphone. Tomorrow night 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.; tickets are $45 and $65. SANNEH RUPEE, Vue, 151 East 50th Street, (212) 802-7267. This summer, Kevin Lyttle had a crossover smash hit with the sublime soca song ''Turn Me On.'' Now this soca singer has a smash with another, noticeably less sublime (but not charmless) soca song, ''Tempted to Touch.'' He is scheduled to perform at this dance party, put on by DJ Cypha Sounds, but don't be surprised if his brief set is less memorable than the D.J.'s, who are to spin the sort of exuberant, eclectic multi-ethnic dance music that New Yorkers are lucky enough to be able to take for granted: hip-hop, reggae, reggaeton, salsa, merengue and more. Tonight after 9; advance tickets are $15 before noon, from www.wantickets.com; expect to pay more at the door, especially if you're male. SANNEH * RICHARD SHINDELL, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Richard Shindell has emerged as one of the folk circuit's most quietly lucid songwriters, with a compassionate intelligence that gleams through his songs. He writes character studies in which finely observed details gradually add up to a larger perspective on love, war and faith. Recently he has been living in Argentina, and his most recent songs have soaked up both rhythms and history there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, sharing a bill with Eliza Gilkyson; admission is $20. PARELES * THE SIX PARTS SEVEN/THE COMAS/HOPEWELL, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. The Six Parts Seven play instrumental rock that unfolds with deliberation and inexorable grace, working through minimalistic guitar-picking patterns and gradual buildups that quickly become mesmerizing. The Comas and Hopewell, who share the bill, are part of the wing of indie-rock that also includes the Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev. Both look back to the majestic side of psychedelia, wafting high tenor voices over stately songs with wah-wah ripples at the edges. Tomorrow night at 8:30; admission is $8. PARELES STEPHAN SMITH, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Stephan Smith -- with his reedy, nasal voice, his acoustic guitar and a constant stream of earnest topical songs -- recalls Bob Dylan in his early days as a Woody Guthrie acolyte. Tonight at 7; admission is $10. PARELES TAKING BACK SUNDAY, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. This Long Island emo band plays modified pop-punk songs, adding hints of ferocity and chaos to its rather straightforward songs. The group's appealing 2002 album, ''Tell All Your Friends'' (Victory), included a handful of frantic but fizzy songs like ''Cute Without the 'E' (Cut From the Team).'' The group has lost a pair of key members since then; perhaps not coincidentally, the follow-up, ''Where You Want to Be'' (Victory), isn't quite as infectious. But it does include ''A Decade Under the Influence,'' an appealingly underhanded love song that unfolds as a swirl of bad-faith pick-up lines: ''To hell with you and all your friends!'' ''Anyone will do tonight.'' ''Close your eyes, just settle.'' And, over and over: ''I've got a bad feeling about this!'' Tonight at 7, with Atreyu, Like Yesterday, and the ferocious British emo band Funeral for a Friend; tickets are $20. SANNEH Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. CLAUDIA ACU\u00d1A QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Ms. Acu\u00f1a, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or, better, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, and they play around with mambos, Middle Eastern scales and improvization that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15. BEN RATLIFF CHARLES GAYLE TRIO, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. The tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle achieved some notoriety in the early 90's as the living embodiment of the first free-jazz era, playing sustained, energetic improvizations with a trio; more recently he's pulled back from the precipice a bit, playing works by bop-era musicians. Tonight at 10; admission is free. RATLIFF * BARRY HARRIS TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. They call Barry Harris Professor Bebop, since he's one of the most revered and approachable teachers on the New York jazz scene, and he's never lost his faith in the righteousness of Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk; his ability to play that music at slower tempos makes it shine more beautifully. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum RATLIFF * COLEMAN HAWKINS CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Since the late 1970's Bennie Wallace has been playing a style of tenor saxophone that's informed by the capacious, luxurious sound of its greatest prewar players, but peppered with more modern details. Here he leads a band celebrating Coleman Hawkins, the first major voice on the instrument and one of the most imposing instrumentalists in jazz; it's a project Mr. Wallace has been touring around festivals for the last year. Tonight and tomorrow the band is a nonet and Sunday it's a quintet; the wonderful pianist Donald Brown, who's seldom seen in New York, plays in both groups. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF DAVID HAZELTINE TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Hazeltine plays piano with definition, strength and lots of postwar jazz knowledge, after the fashion of Cedar Walton; he's at the heart of the current hard-bop resurgence. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, minimum, $10. RATLIFF ARI HOENIG GROUP, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. In the group led by the pianist Jean-Michel Pilc, the drummer Ari Hoenig can be as manic and furious as the bandleader; in other contexts he can lay back. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF * DIEGO MAROTO SEXTET/ANTONIO SANCHEZ GROUP, Dizzy's Club Coca Cola, Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 33 West 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9800. Part of the citywide Mexico Now festival, showcasing new Mexican artists in all disciplines. Mr. Maroto is a post-bop saxophonist in his mid-30's who's become a mainstay of Mexico City's jazz scene, though his band is still unknown around here; Mr. Sanchez, the New York-based drummer, has played in groups with Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden, among others, and his band includes some of the best younger musicians in New York, including the guitarist Adam Rogers, the saxophonists Miguel Zenon and David Sanchez, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Ben Street. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, minimum, $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar. RATLIFF EIVIND OPSVIK, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. Mr. Opsvik, a young Norwegian bassist and bandleader, has an unusual gift for writing small, poignant pieces of music. His melodic shards are strong, as are the chord sequences moving underneath them; he has the distinction, in a time when jazz compositions are becoming increasingly opaque, of writing catchy tunes; his fat-toned, unfussy bass sound enhances them. Sunday night at 9:30; cover charge is $7. RATLIFF * RENEE ROSNES QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Ms. Rosnes is a focused, percussive, highly disciplined pianist and a good example of what the mid-60's mainstream in jazz has evolved to. She also surrounds herself with solid players; this week she plays with the saxophonist Walt Weiskopf, the bassist John Patitucci and the drummer Victor Lewis. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF PHIL WOODS QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Woods, the alto saxophonist, finds his prime sources in bebop before it became canonized; there's a freshness and a force in the continuous phrases of his playing. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $35; minimum, $10. RATLIFF Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. STEPHEN HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95. HOLDEN Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Lots of different singers are wafting through the revival this season; tonight's crop includes Norma Fantini as Aida, Irina Mishura as Amneris and Ambrogio Maestri, who made his company debut on Monday, as Amonasro. When he's on, Franco Farina is a ringing Radam\u00e8s; and the excellent Marcello Viotti conducts. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $35 to $200. ANNE MIDGETTE 'LA CENA DELLE BEFFE' The title's a clunker, the opera's obscure, and yet this ''Dinner of Jests'' marked a big return to operatic success for Umberto Giordano in 1924 after a long string of failures. Now Teatro Grattacielo, whose mission is reviving forgotten verismo operas, is bringing this late work -- sometimes alleged to be the composer's ''dramatic masterpiece,'' never mind ''Andrea Chenier'' -- back to New York in a concert performance, fittingly sung by another artist who's not been heard from much in the last few years, the tenor Lando Bartolini. Also in the cast are Michele Capalbo and Maria Zifchak; Alfredo Silipigni conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $60. MIDGETTE 'I VESPRI SICILIANI' The convoluted story and clunky libretto to Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani'' has probably kept this mature and stirring opera from gaining repertory status. So it's good to have this neglected and important work back at the Met after 22 years, a revival of John Dexter's grimly abstract 1974 production. In the impassioned and stylish performance by the conductor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaslin and a strong cast, ''I Vespri Siciliani'' emerges as a musically distinguished opera that, with its French inflections, anticipates Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlos.'' Don't fret if the story, based on the 1282 uprising by the people of Palermo, Sicily, against their hated French occupiers, seems implausible. Just let yourself get swept away by the music and relish the work of the compelling soprano Sondra Radvanovsky, the husky-voiced (and husky-framed) tenor Francisco Casanova, the elegant baritone Leo Nucci and the stentorian bass Samuel Ramey. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music CERDDORION For its 10th anniversary season, the professional mixed chamber chorus Cerddorion has commissioned three new pieces, one for each of the season's three concert programs. The first, to be performed this weekend, is ''Lamentations for a City,'' by Lisa Bielawa, a singer and composer, who interspersed biblical text about the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians with contemporary news-wire accounts of other cities and other falls. Also on the program are excerpts of Victoria's ''Lamentations of Jeremiah,'' Brahms's ''Warum Ist das Licht Gegeben dem M\u00fchseligen,'' and works by Eric Whitacre and Ian Moss, as well as an earlier piece by Ms. Bielawa. Tomorrow night at 8, Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 569-5593. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 65+. MIDGETTE CHAMPAGNE CLASSICAL CONCERTS In the 1920's, it was not unusual for swanky hotels or restaurants to present classical music concerts, often with several well-known performers each contributing short sets. The Rainbow Room is hoping to revive that quaint tradition, or at least, a hint of it, with a series of Sunday afternoon piano recitals by young, accomplished players. Each recital lasts about 75 minutes, with no intermission, and the somewhat hefty ticket price ($75) includes a drink before the performance and dessert after it. The musical fare is light (if sometimes virtuosic), in keeping with the setting and format. This week the soloist is Max Barros, a Brazilian pianist whose program includes Schumann's ''Arabeske,'' a selection of Chopin Waltzes, Alb\u00e9niz's ''Evocaci\u00f3n'' and ''Asturias'' and Falla's ''Ritual Fire Dance,'' as well as works by several Brazilian composers, among them Villa-Lobos, Nazareth and Guarnieri. Sunday at 5 p.m., the Rainbow Room, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor. (212) 632-5000. Tickets: $75. ALLAN KOZINN KREMERATA BALTICA The superb violinist Gidon Kremer and his crack instrumentalists from the Baltic states play the first of two concerts called ''Shostakovich and After'' -- curiously, since all the music is by Shostakovich. This fascinating program consists of two expansions of chamber works for string orchestra, the Violin Sonata and the Eighth String Quartet, and a relatively intimate presentation of the wrenching Symphony No. 14, with Yulia Korpacheva and Fedor Kuznetsov as vocal soloists. The second concert is in May. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $22 to $69. JAMES R. OESTREICH MOSCOW VIRTUOSI In past visits to New York, this chamber orchestra, led by Vladimir Spivakov, has performed with the polish and zest that its name would lead one to expect. Bartok's Divertimento, one of the three works the group is playing on Sunday afternoon, demands both those qualities. Schoenberg's ''Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht'' demands something else -- an intensity sufficiently focused to illuminate the work's emotional complexities. And the concert's centerpiece, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Mozart and Salieri,'' requires yet another combination of qualities. A quasi-opera based on Pushkin, the work uses the apocryphal story of Mozart's murder by Salieri as a way of showing the triumph of great art. The score includes quotations from Alexander Dargomizhsky's ''Stone Guest'' -- another Pushkin-derived work -- and if audiences today don't catch them, there are also allusions to a handful of Mozart works. The singers in the Rimsky-Korsakov are Dmitry Korchak, a tenor, and Sergei Leiferkus, a baritone. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall. There is also a preconcrert lecture at 12:45 in the Kaplan Penthouse, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $56. KOZINN MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO Every summer at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont gifted fledgling artists play chamber music with renowned veterans. Working on chamber music is the priority; the weekend public concerts come second. Typically, the programs are not announced in advance. But playing for the public is the point of the Marlboro tour. The Metropolitan Museum plays host to the series in New York, and the first of three concerts this season comes tonight. The violinists Ida Levin and Colin Jacobsen, the violist Maurycy Banaszek, the cellist Yumi Kendall and the pianist Jeremy Denk will offer performances of Mozart's ebullient Piano Quartet in E flat, Franck's stormy Piano Quintet in F minor and the Duo for Violin and Piano of Leon Kirchner, one of America's most distinguished composers and a longtime Marlboro participant. Tonight at 8., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35. TOMMASINI NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE It may be that most of the young musicians who study at the Juilliard School enrolled in the hope of polishing their technique and learning the great works of the Classical and Romantic repertory. But many of them get something else as well: a firm and thoroughly practical grounding in the latest contemporary music. That side of their training is overseen, to a great degree, by the enterprising Joel Sachs, a conductor with an estimable track record for finding fascinating new works and composers. His programs with the New Juilliard Ensemble, the school's premier contemporary music chamber orchestra, have been consistently demanding and satisfying, and his players work hard to master the works he puts before them. Tonight Mr. Sachs leads a program that includes the world premieres of Virko Baley's Symphony No. 2, Paul Desenne's ''Sinfonia Burocratica ed Amazzonica'' and Wei-Chieh Lin's ''Dialogues.'' Also on the program are the New York premieres of Josef Bardanashvili's ''Steps'' and Stefano Gervasoni's ''Antiterra.'' Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Free, but tickets are required. KOZINN NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC After basing his career in Europe for roughly 20 years, the American conductor James Conlon has cut back his ties overseas to focus more on his home country. This is good news for the many New York admirers of this dynamic, insightful and adventurous conductor. This weekend at the New York Philharmonic he has chosen a fascinating program. The longest work is Mahler's visionary Symphony No. 1, sometimes called the ''Titan.'' But in the first half Mr. Conlon conducts the New York premiere of Peter Lieberson's ''Red Garuda,'' a 25-minute, four-movement work for piano and orchestra written for Peter Serkin, which received its premiere in Boston in 1999. Mr. Lieberson is a practicing Buddhist, and in Buddhist mythology a garuda is a reddish bird that flies without ceasing, a symbol of absolute freedom. Mr. Serkin is the soloist for these performances. Mr. Conlon has said he sees Mahler and Lieberson as soul mates. The two works should complement each other powerfully. Today at 11 a.m. and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $22 to $74 this morning, $25 to $90 tomorrow night. TOMMASINI ORION STRING QUARTET The ensemble begins the latest survey of Bartok's six string quartets playing the first two and the fourth at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon. Images of Bartok the hard-nosed modernist will be moderated by the early pieces, which are deeply Romantic and more than a little influenced by one of the composer's idols, Franz Liszt. The fourth quartet, perhaps the most satisfying of the lot, is central in several ways. Numerically, it stands in the middle of the six. More interesting, its ethereal central movement acts as a kind of sun toward which the outer movements are magnetically attracted. This is a Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center event. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $48 to $27.50. BERNARD HOLLAND ANDR\u00c9 WATTS You may know Andr\u00e9 Watts as a well-traveled solo pianist and as a soloist with orchestras, but you are less likely to know him as a chamber musician. Here he collaborates with the clarinetist David Shifrin, the violist Paul Neubauer and another pianist, Georg Schenk, in an attractive program of Mozart and Poulenc. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35. OESTREICH Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. BARNARD DANCE AT MILLER THEATER The Barnard dance department has raised the choreographic ante in recent years, in these rite-of-passage programs for its students, with works by artists who here include Paul Taylor (''Aureole'') and Mark Morris (''Marble Halls''). The program also includes dances by Laveen Naidu and Aszure Barton. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Miller Theater, Columbia University, east side of Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $15; $6 for 65+. JENNIFER DUNNING KAREN BERNARD AND NATHALIE CLAUDE Ms. Bernard's solo choreography and performing cries out that older is indeed bolder in a serene sort of way. She will present a piece in which a hand-held mirror reflects perceptions of aging. Ms. Claude, from the honorary blue state of Canada, will present ''The Sadness Trilogy.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736. Tickets: $12 or TDF; $10 for students and 65+. DUNNING COMPLEXIONS: A CONCEPT IN DANCE Hot and hip -- and occasionally working a little too hard at that -- the repertory by Dwight Rhoden is full of very contemporary attitude in a mix of modern dance, ballet and club dancing. Sunday at 2 p.m. Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, (718) 951-4500. Tickets: $30. DUNNING DEEPLY ROOTED DANCE THEATER Formerly the Jubilation! company, this almost evangelically exuberant black modern-dance group will present a program that includes the premiere of ''MOVE!,'' created by artistic director Kevin Iega Jeff and Gary Abbott, with a text written by Stacey Ann Chin of ''Def Poetry Jam'' on Broadway. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday at 3 p.m. Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Harlem, (212) 650-7100; www.aarondavishall.org. Tickets: $20 to $35. DUNNING * ''AN EVENING OF DANCE'' The modestly entitled program is this weekend's wild-card event. The choreographers include Sigal Bergman, a vibrant and savvy performer whose piece uses Arab and Israeli folk dancing to explore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ren\u00e9e Archibald and Daryl Owens poetically describe their piece as being about indefinable somethings, perhaps music that stopped a moment ago or a fingerprint on a mirror. And Yasuko's quartet transforms the world of Raymond Carver into Kabuki dance theater. Can't get much more eclectic than that. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn (718) 832-0018. Tickets: $15. DUNNING GARTH FAGAN DANCE Fresh from performing in the opening festival of the new Frederick P. Rose Hall at Jazz at Lincoln Center, this troupe of fast-streaming dancers heads south for a regular dance gig. The program will include a world premiere and performances of Mr. Fagan's ''Dancecollageforromie,'' an intimidating title that seems to have little to do with the plainspoken art of Romare Bearden that inspired the dance. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Saturday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Manhattan (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42. DUNNING 'FOREVER TANGO' Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dances and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, Manhattan (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85 DUNNING RENNIE HARRIS'S LEGENDS OF HIP-HOP Rennie Harris has created a fast-paced journey through hip-hop history in which he honors the pioneers of hip-hop and presents a panorama of styles, all in only 50 minutes. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 12 and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Theater District, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30. JACK ANDERSON INSPIRIT Directed by Christal Brown, this new all-female modern-dance group is made up of dancers who also perform with Ronald K. Brown, H. T. Chen and Nathan Trice. The program's choreographic collaborations include the new ''Becoming,'' with live music by Tu Bab Crew and Count Clovis and poetry by Glennis Redmond. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+. DUNNING CHRISTINE JOWERS/MOVING ARTS PROJECTS It is the brave performer who tries to make history live again on the stage. But Ms. Jowers and her company will do just that in ''Awakening Dancing Goddesses, Real and Imagined,'' a wide-ranging program of dance by Isadora Duncan, premieres by Janis Brenner, Larry Keigwin and Rachel Cohen, and repertory pieces by Ann Carlson, Kun Yang Lin and Catlin Cobb. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15; $12 for 65+ and students with identification. DUNNING KINDING SINDAW This resident dance company at La MaMa will present ''Parang Sabil'' (''Sword of Honor''), a theater dance piece that depicts the American conquest of the Tausug people of the Philippines early in the 20th century. The slaughter drew outrage from Mark Twain, whose commentaries are incorporated into the piece. The program also includes traditional Philippine dances and music. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, just west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $20. DUNNING VALENTINA KOZLOVA'S DANCE CONSERVATORY PERFORMANCE PROJECT Ms. Kozlova, a former principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet and New York City Ballet, is always a charmer, even in the less than impressive choreography she tends to present. Another pleasure is the sight of her young dancers working their way through challenging classical ballet pieces with impressive courage and aplomb. Tonight at 7:30. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $35; $20 for children and 65+; $12 for dance students. DUNNING LAKOTA SIOUX INDIAN DANCE THEATER Directed by Henry Smith, a choreographer with a long history of involvement in American Indian dance, this company of Sioux Nation performers, founded in 1978 on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, will perform ''Cokata Upo!'' (''Come to the Center''), a celebration of the Lakota culture. Sunday at 3 p.m. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95h Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $26; $15 for children and students. DUNNING ELISE LONG AND PENE McCOURTY Ms. Long, a staple of the Brooklyn modern dance scene, will join Ms. McCourty, who has danced with Liz Lerman and Marlies Yearby, for ''Stories Our Bodies Dance,'' an evening that features trained and amateur performers from Brooklyn. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. Spoke the Hub Re:Creation Center, 748 Union Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 408-3234. Tickets: $12; $5 for children and 65+. DUNNING JULIE ATLAS MUZ In her new ''I Am the Moon and You are the Man on Me,'' Ms. Muz, a coolly hip postmodernist burlesque performer of downtown renown, will play Luna, a woman she describes as irredeemably involved in slow and difficult love affairs. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Sunday) at 8 p.m. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $15. DUNNING JANAKI PATRIK'S KATHAK ENSEMBLE & FRIENDS The centerpiece of the program will be Ms. Patrik's new ''Power Play,'' based on traditional Indian Kathak dance and set to piano music by Dinuk Wijeratne, a Sri Lankan composer. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 673-1282. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and 65+. DUNNING STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces, in this closing weekend of the company's fall season. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15. DUNNING TANZTHEATER WUPPERTAL PINA BAUSCH One of the eternal verities of dance, Ms. Bausch first brought her company to Brooklyn two decades ago. Her dances have grown lighter and more playful than ironic, but she may be returning to darker stuff in ''F\u00fcr die Kinder von Gestern, Heute und Morgen'' (''For the Children of Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow''), an ode to dancers at each state of their lives. No one mixes dance, drama, dialogue and startling visuals quite so boldly as Ms. Bausch. This piece takes place in a white box with movable doors and windows and also features two men on a table, black cocktail dresses and brooms used for combs. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org. Tickets: $35 to $75. DUNNING ELLIS WOOD DANCE. Ms. Wood makes dark, dense dances for women. Her choreography sometimes seems to have been written out in blood. The dances Ms. Wood will present here address a bizarre red female phantasm, an egg-obsessed small-town waitress and the feel of a hurricane wind as it flies into one's lap. The dependably imaginative composer of note is Daniel Bernard Roumain. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20. DUNNING Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+. HOLLAND COTTER * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. COTTER 'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+. COTTER 'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28), where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Hours and admission: see above. GRACE GLUECK * 'PERSONAL AFFECTS: POWER AND POETICS IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN ART,' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700) and St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 111th Street, through Jan. 3 and Dec. 5, respectively. This two-part exhibition traces what its curators call a ''post-identity'' development in South African art since the end of apartheid, with issues of class, race and gender subsumed under other personal or abstract concerns. For the occasion, the museum commissioned new pieces from 17 artists, some specifically for the cathedral. The installation there is more than just effective. It's the strongest group show of new art anywhere in the city so far this season. But certain artists are seen to better advantage in the smaller-scale spaces of the Museum of African art itself. All in all, the show's two halves are forcefully complementary. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+. COTTER * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers and a 14-piece pocketknife, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: see above. KIMMELMAN 'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, through Feb. 6. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are downplayed, and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens citizen for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+. COTTER Galleries: Uptown BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead. KEN JOHNSON ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points. GLUECK * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism. ROBERTA SMITH * 'PICASSO-BECKMANN/BECKMANN-PICASSO,' Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 31. This wonderfully illuminating exhibition brings together two great 20th-century artists who are not ordinarily closely associated. It includes significant as well as interesting minor works by both. Picasso's colorful, thickly painted late-30's picture of a bull goring a horse is worth a visit all by itself, and so is Beckmann's ''Soldier's Dream'' from 1942, a darkly comical allegory of lust and death with bird-man and bird-woman lovers in a cage and a floozy sitting outside with a big clock. JOHNSON 'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Sol\u00f3rzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape painted in orange and white on the wall; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jos\u00e9 D\u00e1vila. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 3. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown. COTTER Galleries: Chelsea SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet to be published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog. JOHNSON RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies. JOHNSON CILDO MEIRELES: 'STRICTU AND DESCALA,' Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Dec. 4. Concerned with changing the spectator's role from passive to active, Mr. Meireles, a Brazilian environmental artist, offers a heavy-breathing account of how spaces can be used to control mind and body. On a wooden interrogation table in a dark room is a statement condemning societal authoritarianism. The viewer is invited to don handcuffs attached to a ball and chain while viewing the second work: flat ladders and runged poles line the walls of a smaller gallery, creating a handsome compositional surround, Mondrianlike in its reductive effect. GLUECK Other Galleries * 'AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY: 1945-1980 [DEBATING MODERNISM],' Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, (718) 631-6396, through Jan. 13. Recently reopened after a two-year renovation, this gallery is being promoted as a showplace, and justly so: it looks spiffy and its opening show is an ambitous one that rethinks canonical accounts of American modernism. Gold-standard artists like Pollock are joined by less successful contemporaries, and Photo Realism, a movement until recently out of favor, is reconsidered. Is the show cohesive? No, but it's stimulating and fun, with some terrific underknown works by familiar artists. COTTER IAN HAMILTON FINLAY, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 52nd Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 3. Mr. Finlay, a Scottish poet, artist, gardener and rebel, born in 1925, aches for the past and feels its impact on the present. His graphic works are inspired by the French Revolution, classical art and literature, boats, World War II and his renowned garden. An expert typographer, he often fashions images from words or combinations of letters alone, placing them in punchy arrangements. Best are his images of ships, which occasionally take wry turns. Type fanciers and concrete poetry buffs will have a picnic; others may want to take along a cryptograph to fathom his buried meanings. GLUECK 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER 'JAMAICA FLUX: WORKSPACES AND WINDOWS,' Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718) 658-7400, through Jan. 8. Although some of the work in this ambitious show is in the gallery, much is embedded in the surrounding environment, a major shopping strip. A local branch of North Fork Bank yields sculptures on the themes of wealth and illusions. Street posters adapt corporate marketing strategies to ecourage the use of libraries. The collective called Center for Urban Pedagogy planted models for urban architecture among footwear displays in Sneaker Mart Plus, and the artist Liselot van der Heijden's places a pointedly edited version of George W. Bush's 2004 State of the Union address in a shop among tapes of speeches by Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. COTTER ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting. JOHNSON SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment. JOHNSON Last Chance SAM CADY: 'MAINE, NEW PAINTINGS,' Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669, through Wednesday. In this group of mostly shaped canvases, closely tailored to fit the subjects, Mr. Cady celebrates the Maine coastal village he lives in, where boats are built, fish are caught and seagulls clamor. His chef d'oeuvre, ''Morning Mirage, Jones Garden,'' depicts a long, narrow, horizontal stripe of shore eight feet long by a little over three inches wide. No sky and no water are shown, but tiny islands appear at the top, giving the effect of a very distant view from a boat out in the water. Other ingenuities include cut-outs in the shape of a small dory; the hulls of a couple of boats being built, and a snow-covered dock from a walk-on perspective. But the painting is a little too slick to be all that down-homey. GLUECK 'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Chelsea, (212) 966-7745, through Sunday. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the president's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the President humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq.

Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Theater Broadway + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95. BEN BRANTLEY * 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly half a century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in 'The Little Shop of Horrors,' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous. This show, as Edna sings, is ''all about me.'' It's a joy to be with a Broadway diva who doesn't pretend otherwise (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50. BRANTLEY * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters. It may take you 15 minutes or so to become oriented as to the rules and players on the drama's fragmented political field. But as you watch the well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble, led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas, you're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Today at 2 and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95. BRANTLEY + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. As she relates in ''The Good Body,'' ''I said the word vagina vagina vagina a million times. I thought I was home free. I had finally come to like my vagina. Until one day I realized the self-hatred had just crept up into my stomach.'' Like ''Vagina Monologues,'' ''The Good Body'' aims to uplift and to empower as it entertains. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish production, directed by Peter Askin, can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply. Where ''Vagina Monologues'' broke new ground, ''Good Body'' mostly sticks to well-trodden pathways (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performances today at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance. CHARLES ISHERWOOD + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25. ISHERWOOD + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother,'' directed by Michael Mayer. Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage, folding towels, making cocoa: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25. BRANTLEY *+ 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to the Lyceum Theater on Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. The movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago, the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49, Ms. Goldberg is now an established performer, and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg remains an engaging presence, but this sluggish show desperately needs a stringent theatrical intelligence. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen different characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing. ''Whoopi'' is still good company, to be sure. And yet, as anyone who has observed her eclectic career knows, she is perhaps not always the best judge of material. ''Whoopi'' offers further evidence that, innately incandescent though she may be, Ms. Goldberg's gifts shine brightest when they are strictly harnessed (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25. ISHERWOOD *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'BELLE \u00c9POQUE' The poque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. As in their prior collaboration, ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' the authors seek to strip away the sentimental varnish that has congealed around popular depictions of the milieu they are exploring. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Mee are intrigued by the gloom beneath the gaiety. ''Belle \u00c9poque'' focuses on the painter who immortalized the denizens of Montmartre in his art. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. And Ms. Clarke's staging has a bustling freedom that is a fine theatrical metaphor for the restless speed of Toulouse-Lautrec's acute eye, forever settling on unexpected moments and awkward poses. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle \u00c9poque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70. ISHERWOOD * 'DOUBT: A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. BRANTLEY 'FIVE BY TENN' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. The director Michael Kahn employs an actor portraying Williams himself to introduce the plays, a faintly apologetic gesture. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere, the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. In ''The Fat Man's Wife,'' from 1938, Williams is trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance. ISHERWOOD 'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25. BRANTLEY * 'THE GOD OF HELL' Sam Shepard's robust new farce, which he has described as ''a takeoff on Republican fascism,'' is neither a smooth nor subtle play. But at its best it has a punch-drunk paranoia that brings to mind Mr. Shepard's salad days as the ultimate wild young dramatist of several decades ago. Directed by Lou Jacob, this 90-minute portrait of an old-time America invaded by a cruel new breed of Americans starts off much more satisfyingly than it finishes. And what it has to say about a nation forced to march in regimental lockstep is pretty standard agitprop. But unlike, say, the more literal-minded ''Embedded,'' Tim Robbins's satire about the invasion of Iraq, ''The God of Hell'' pokes fun at its own righteous self as well as its broad political targets. The show's top-of-the-line cast is led by Randy Quaid and J. Smith-Cameron, who are priceless as a politically na\u00efve farming couple in rural Wisconsin (1:20). Actors Studio Drama School Theater, 151 Bank Street, (212) 279-4200. Mondays, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60. BRANTLEY *+ 'GUANT\u00c1NAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. BRANTLEY 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays. ISHERWOOD * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and na\u00efve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Mr. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60. ISHERWOOD 'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD 'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60. ISHERWOOD *+ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25. ISHERWOOD + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 505-0700. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. Now Playing 'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp. STEPHEN HOLDEN 'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies, but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges. MANOHLA DARGIS 'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Francis Ford Coppola had Preston Tucker, the automotive innovator who tried and failed to challenge Detroit in much the same way as the filmmaker took on Hollywood, while Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now, Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, get away from his kvetch of a mother. And what a kvetch she was! Mad of eye and teased of hair, Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion and the tedium of the perpetual nag. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in both Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom. DARGIS * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Fele Mart\u00ednez and Javier C\u00e1mara. Directed by Pedro Almod\u00f3var (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The great Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless film makers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almod\u00f3var, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education,'' which ricochets back and forth between 1964 and 1980, with a finale set mostly in 1977, is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. Once a beautiful boy soprano, he/she was abused by a priest, the principal in his Catholic boys school. As the film deepens and the characters' mistaken and multiple identities accumulate, the priest returns from the past in a new, desperate guise. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling itself and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual. It insists that stories, the stories within stories, and the fantasies they crystallize, are the best (and maybe the only) tools at our disposal for making sense of it all. HOLDEN 'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A.O. SCOTT 'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re wrote many scripts for Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can. SCOTT 'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? At the screening a lot of women were cackling lustily every time the camera zoomed in on Bridget's bulbous posterior, which of course looks much like the posterior of most women who don't live for Pilates and in Beverly Hills. Ms. Kidron took obvious delight in this unhappy view, too. She either really disliked her star or thinks humiliating other women is great sport. Whatever the case, you have to wonder why all these women (you go, sister!) relish the spectacle of a normally well-coiffed, highly paid Academy Award-winning actress, who dates rock stars no less, looking so bad. Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, as plush and appealing as an Eiderdown comforter, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck. Doesn't the poor thing read fashion magazines or go shopping in London's boutiques and groovy outdoor markets? Doesn't she wash her hair? DARGIS 'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy with a screenplay by Chris Columbus, adapted from John Grisham's novel ''Skipping Christmas.'' The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. Until he stumbles upon it in an act of giving, he doesn't realize there is only one true path to the saccharine suffocation of ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' Its name is Hemlock Street, and he happens to live on it with his wife (Ms. Curtis) and their grown daughter (Julie Gonzalo). For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community. HOLDEN 'FEAR AND TREMBLING' Starring Sylvie Testud and Kaori Tsuji. Directed by Alain Corneau (not rated, 102 minutes; in French and Japanese, with English subtitles). Like ''Lost in Translation,'' Mr. Corneau's film, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Am\u00e9lie Nothomb, concerns a young woman undergoing a painful and comical process of self-discovery in a Tokyo high-rise. The heroine, Am\u00e9lie (Ms. Testud) has moved from Belgium to Japan, where she spent her early childhood, and where she takes a job working for a large corporation in the hopes of becoming ''a real Japanese woman.'' It's a doomed project, owing both the the long-standing Japanese suspicion of foreigners and to the intricate codes and hierarchies that govern Am\u00e9lie's workplace. What starts as a breezy exercise in office anthropology becomes a harrowing, sometimes hilarious exploration of bureaucratic sado-masochism, a blend of ''The Office'' and ''The Story of O'' trasplanted to Asia. SCOTT 'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Born in Scotland in 1860, Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' has been revisited numerous times, as in the splendid 1952 Disney animation, and has become an emblem for everlasting youth, both healthy and less so. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. Based on the play by Allan Knee, ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan,'' the film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children and the two adult actors exchange suitably noble looks even when Ms. Winslet's d\u00e9colletage threatens to play peek-a-boo. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote. DARGIS 'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat going meo-o-o-ow. DARGIS * 'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost na\u00efve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight. Crisp performances by Ms. Linney, as Kinsey's wife, and Mr. Sarsgaard, as his first research assistant bring the complexities of Kinsey's life into sharp relief. SCOTT 'LA PETITE LILI' Starring Nicole Garcia, Bernard Giraudeau, Jean-Pierre Marielle and Ludivine Sagnier. Directed by Claude Miller (not rated, 104 minutes; in French, with subtitles). In dragging ''The Seagull'' into the age of cellphones, digital video and hip-hop, the ingeniously freewheeling adaptation of Chekhov's 1895 play stirs up a fascinating and contradictory mixture of the eternal and the transitory. But there are hurdles that ''La Petite Lili'' cannot overcome. Abridged and abbreviated, Chekhov's leisurely philosophic reflections evoke a musty aroma of pressed flowers in a scrapbook that's out of tune with the times. The rush to abridge leaves little room for what's left to seep into your bones. In the revelatory final act, many of the original characters converge on a movie set to recreate the events we have already seen. The movie within a movie is a small coup de cin\u00e9ma. HOLDEN * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show (a Grade C ''Amazing Race'') with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine. HOLDEN * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out. SCOTT 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BLUES EXPLOSION, THE GOSSIP, Asbury Lanes, 209 4th Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 776-6160; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Blues Explosion, the long-in-the-tooth retro-rock band that used to be called the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, somehow failed to capitalize during the great retro-rock feeding frenzy of a few years ago, perhaps because Mr. Spencer's hammy snarl has aged less well than bandmate Judah Bauer's well-oiled guitar lines. So don't be surprised if the veterans are upstaged by the Gossip, a barebones blues-punk band led by Beth Ditto, possessed of an appealing shivery wail. Sunday night at 9 at the venerable bowling alley Asbury Lanes, with Mike Edison; tickets are $15. Monday night at 9 at Maxwell's; tickets are $15. KELEFA SANNEH EVAN DANDO, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. From his days with the Lemonheads to his fitful solo career, Evan Dando at his best, has been able to wrap winsome melodies around chronicles of uncertain romance and an unkempt life, in songs like ''If I Could Talk I'd Tell You.'' Tomorrow night at 10, with the Shore opening; admission is $15. JON PARELES * BRITT DANIEL, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Mr. Daniel leads Spoon, a great Texas indie-rock band that wastes neither time nor notes. Spoon's last album, ''Kill the Moonlight,'' was one of 2002's best, a minor masterpiece that reduced every song to a series of gestures: a dash of falsetto, a couple of keyboard notes, a swaggering ''Awright!'' When he sang, ''We could go kick down some doors together/ Stay out till morning, sharp as knives,'' it sounded like the best idea in the world. At this solo show, expect the diehard Spoon fans to feast on whatever he sees to fit to play -- including, perhaps, some previews of Spoon's new album, due to be released sometime next year. Tonight at 10; tickets are $12. SANNEH * DIPLO, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Riving Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Diplo, one half of the Philadelphia indie-crunk DJ team Hollertronix, comes to town for a Saturday night dance party. Earlier this year, he released a grab-bag solo album, ''Florida'' (Big Dada), but more exciting is his new gig as DJ for M.I.A., the Sri-Lanka-born, London-based rapper and singer and chanter whose debut album is due out early next year. Together, Diplo and M.I.A. just released a fantastic mixtape, ''Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1,'' which is better than most proper debut albums; don't leave Rothko without one. Tomorrow night at 11, with Spank Rock; admission is $10. SANNEH DISCO BISCUITS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. The Disco Biscuits have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz, hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs and sometimes turns into a live version of electronica styles, like drum-and-bass, that are usually concocted on computers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $20. PARELES DR. JOHN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and his florid piano playing not just to New Orleans funk and rhythm-and-blues but to Ellington, standards and songs with a conscience, though his latest album circles back to some New Orleans classics. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 day of the show. PARELES * ELY GUERRA, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ely Guerra is one of the most intriguing songwriters in Mexican rock. Ms. Guerra sings about passion: gazing at it from a distance, then plunging into the turbulence. Her songs incorporate rock, electronica and the torchy emotion of Mexican pop in a shifting balance of poise and obsession. She has just released a new album, ''Sweet & Sour, Hot y Spicy'' (Higher Octave). Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; admission is $20. PARELES ARLO GUTHRIE, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Arlo Guthrie is a master of the tall tale, whether he's singing it or spinning it between songs. He has the gift of making a casual observation both funny and telling. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38-$65. PARELES HOT TUNA, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from the Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38.50 and $48.50. PARELES * JADAKISS, DON OMAR, the Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-5156. The Yonkers rapper Jadakiss has long been an underground hero, beloved for his slightly rough voice that just makes his clever, deadpan lyrics sound that much smoother. He's having his biggest year ever, buoyed by the success of his marvelous hit single ''Why?,'' and the follow-up, a thug-love duet with Mariah Carey called, ''U Make Me Wanna.'' He is to be joined by Don Omar, one of reggaeton's biggest stars, who delighted a sold-out Madison Square Garden last month with his infectious refrains and with his trouser-dropping -- expect less trouser dropping, but just as many refrains, at this concert. Tonight at 8, with the former Terror Squad member Cuban Link; tickets are $35. SANNEH EDDIE AND GERALD LEVERT, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, L.I., (516) 334-0800. This concert pairs Eddie Levert, who was one of the gospel-charged soul singers in the O'Jays, with his son Gerald, who plays the rhythm-and-blues Casanova with alternating promises of fidelity and bedroom skills. Tonight at 8; tickets are $56.50. PARELES * LUNA/PALOMAR, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar New York bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. As Mr. Wareham sings about high-toned parties, aimless roadtrips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. The band is on its final tour, to end early next year. Whimsy and sinew co-exist nicely in the lean, peppy pop-rock of Palomar, a three-woman, one-man band whose songs jump from blithe choruses to wiry guitar patterns to hefty distortion, all at the service of the lyrics' articulate ambivalence. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $18.75 in advance, $20 day of the show. PARELES * BOB MOULD, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. As the main songwriter for Husker Du, Bob Mould wrapped troubled thoughts in blaring, unstoppable guitars. Since then, he has veered between melodic punk-rock with Sugar and more introspective songs under his own name. Tonight at 9, with Alex Dezen of the Damnwells opening; admission is $17. PARELES O.A.R., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224 . A little reggae, a little folk-rock, a lot of word-of-mouth and O.A.R., an Ohio band whose initials stand for Of a Revolution, has become a college-circuit favorite. Despite its name, O.A.R. is more concerned with romance than politics; it plays easy-strumming three-chord songs suitable for dorm parties, calling for audience participation on choruses like ''Naked with you all night long.'' John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. Tonight and tomorrow at 6:30, with the John Butler Trio opening tonight and the Virginia Coalition opening tomorrow; tickets are $30. PARELES * STRAYLIGHT RUN, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. An emo concert headlined by Straylight Run, the Long Island piano-rock act that includes a pair of former Taking Back Sunday members. The band's self-titled debut album (released last month by Victory Records) has a few too many mild ballads, but the members have a knack for writing big choruses that are just unpredictable enough to keep you listening. Expect a roaring sing-along to ''Existentialism on Prom Night,'' which includes a shameless -- and clever -- refrain that begs for crowd participation: ''Sing like you think no one's listening.'' Sunday night at 7, with Hot Rod Circuit, Northstar and Say Anything; tickets are $13. SANNEH * CHRIS WHITLEY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Chris Whitley is steeped in the blues: not good-timey bar-band music but steely, tormented reflections on sin and self-destruction, betrayal and redemption. As he sings about a world of uncertainty and pain, his voice slides while his slide-guitar moans along. Tomorrow night at 8, with Paul Brill opening; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow. PARELES Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. STEPHEN HOLDEN * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows. HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95. HOLDEN Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. The trumpeter Steven Bernstein leads his nine-piece mini-big band through Midwestern and Southwestern music of the 1930's with a revisionist, excitable cast of mind. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $10. BEN RATLIFF * SASHA DOBSON/CHRIS BYARS OCTET, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369. The young singer Sasha Dobson performed a lot with the saxophonist Chris Byars at the old jazz club Smalls, whose owner changed locations and called his new place the Fat Cat. With the recent launching of Small Records and her own release on the label, ''The Darkling Thrush,'' Ms. Dobson returns to her old audience in a new setting. She's a canny improviser with classic Ella-and-Sarah tastes and good pitch; Mr. Byars's arrangements of standards fit her handsomely. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 10; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF LOU DONALDSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The saxophonist Lou Donaldson reminds you of the earthiness inside jazz. He is also a wild, funny character who always plays better than you expect on an average night. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF STAN GETZ BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. The ubiquitous pianist Bill Charlap, along with the singer Claudia Acu\u00f1a and the Brazilian jazz band Trio da Paz, play alongside the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen in honor of Getz's New York-to-Rio recorded legacy. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10, and 11:30, with sets at 8:45 and 10:30 on Sunday; cover charge is $32.50; minimum, $10. RATLIFF RUSSELL GUNN AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Russell Gunn, from St. Louis, is a young hard-core jazz trumpeter who has worked behind R & B stars; logically, he seems to want his work to build a sensible bridge between the jazz and neo-soul audiences. He has a separate, mainstream jazz band, but with Ethnomusicology, he wants to relax you with soul ballads, then to challenge you with crunching dissonance and hard funk. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF * COLEMAN HAWKINS CELEBRATION WITH ERIC ALEXANDER AND GEORGE COLEMAN, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. This is the centennial of the great Coleman Hawkins's birth, and the tribute concerts have been going strong; this one might be particularly good because it's essentially a working group, with Harold Mabern on piano, rather than an ad-hoc confection. The young tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander is probably more indebted to 50's- and 60's-era models like John Coltrane and George Coleman, who appears alongside him in this band. But he and his muse will surely sound good playing ''Body and Soul'' and other Hawkinsiana. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30; $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar. RATLIFF * MARK HELIAS'S OPEN LOOSE, Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. The bassist Mark Helias has been a reliable part of a lot of groups around New York for the last few decades, but his own trio is the best setting in which to hear him, as it engages his compositional sense as well as his convincing bounce. With the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the drummer Tom Rainey, he steams through winding themes and great ostinato grooves. Tonight at 8:30; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF VICTOR LEWIS GROUP, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Victor Lewis is a marvelous drummer, known in the 80's for associations with Stan Getz and Bobby Watson and in the 90's for freelancing and playing with his own band. This one includes the saxophonist Seamus Blake and the trumpeter Terrell Stafford. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20; $10 minimum. RATLIFF * BRIAN LYNCH AND SPHERES OF INFLUENCE, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. With a recent Doris Duke Foundation grant, Mr. Lynch wrote new music for his band Spheres of Influence, expanding the group in the process; it's now a nonet, with some of the most exciting musicians in the new Latin-jazz scene including the saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. The saxophonist Houston Person's background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm-and-blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. (Many of the others became session musicians, going deeper into the studiousness of jazz or into the meat and potatoes of rock 'n' roll, or they disappeared.) Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins, and a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $20, and there is a one drink minimum. RATLIFF TOOTS THIELEMANS-KENNY WERNER-OSCAR CASTRO-NEVES-AIRTO MOREIRA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A Belgian-American-Brazilian configuration of jazz musicians with big ears and great songbook knowledge on, respectively, harmonica, piano, guitar and percussion. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35 at the tables with a $15 minimum, and $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum. RATLIFF STEVE TURRE QUINTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The trombonist Steve Turre has knocked around jazz, Latin music, funk and all kinds of professional situations, including a long-standing place in the ''Saturday Night Live'' band; he was also an associate of the great, eccentric saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk and pays tribute to him on a new record, ''The Spirits Up Above'' (Highnote). Sets tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20; there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Lots of different singers have wafted through this revival this season; this afternoon's cast includes Norma Fantini as Aida, Irina Mishura as Amneris and Ambrogio Maestri, who made his company debut this month, as Amonasro. When he's on, Franco Farina is a ringing Radames, and the excellent Marcello Viotti conducts. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $315; returns may be available at the box office. ANNE MIDGETTE 'LA BOH\u00c9ME' The ascent of the golden-voiced Russian soprano Anna Netrebko has been so rapid that no doubt many local opera fans are yet to hear her live. This weekend provides another opportunity as she sings Musetta at the Met in Franco Zeffirelli's outsize production of this Puccini favorite. At her side will be Ruth Ann Swenson as Mimi. It's a heftier and more dramatic role for Ms. Swenson, who is better known for her beautifully nimble coloratura soprano, but she held her own last month at the first performance. Elsewhere in the cast, Peter Mattei sings an impressive Marcello, with rich, deep colors in his baritone. Frank Lopardo has replaced Marcelo Alvarez as Rodolfo. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215. JEREMY EICHLER 'TANNH\u00c4USER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert has all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor, and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. As Elisabeth the soprano Deborah Voigt, who has shed weight and looked splendid, sings with gleaming sound and effortless power. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. The mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung is a striking and vocally impassioned Venus, though she is still finding her way into the role technically. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $315. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music FERRARA ENSEMBLE The valuable Music Before 1800 series is presenting this Swiss vocal and instrumental ensemble in ''Tr\u00e8s Riche Heures: Gothic Music for the Valois Dukes,'' a program of French courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th centuries. The group, directed by Crawford Young (who also plays the lute in the ensemble), is an outgrowth of a 1984 recording project at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, where it is now an ensemble in residence. Its program includes ballades, rondeaus and instrumental pieces by Machaut, Caserta, Paullet, Foliot, Vaillant and Grenon. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Manhattan, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+. ALLAN KOZINN ANDR\u00c9 WATTS This pianist has been an uneven player in recent years, but a chamber music concert at the Metropolitan Museum last week found him in fine shape. For his recital on Sunday, Mr. Watts is performing a varied program that includes a group of Scarlatti Sonatas, Haydn's Sonata No. 58 in C, Schubert's Klavierst\u00fccke (D. 946), Debussy's ''Estampes,'' Lizst's ''Hungarian Rhapsody'' No. 13, as well as selections from ''Musica Ricercata,'' a 1951 suite by the great contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti. Sunday at 3, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $54. KOZINN Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 'ASIAN GAMES: THE ART OF CONTEST,' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9211, through Jan. 16. What's your game? Chess, go, pachisi, polo? These and many other recreational pursuits are saluted in a jampacked but beguiling show that pegs Asia as the continent of origin for more than a few of the sophisticated games we play today. On view are 200 games and game-related objects covering 2,000 years. They involve games of chance; memory and matching; strategy and physical skill. Elaborate boards for dice-propelled contests like pachisi, backgammon and snakes and ladders; different varieties of dice; intricately carved chessmen; lively examples of playing cards, and intriguing paraphernalia for outdoor sports like polo, are all part of this sumptuous display, enhanced by paintings, prints, sculptures and decorative accessories. A playground for the eye, even a non-gamesman's. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+. GRACE GLUECK * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+. HOLLAND COTTER * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. COTTER * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold B\u00f6cklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH 'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+. COTTER 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4. GLUECK MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. The mobs will inevitably congregate on that floor, so a good alternative for visitors is to explore the museum within the museum: the suites of galleries for prints, drawings, photographs and design -- mostly intimate places to peruse some of the greatest of all works of modern art. Prints provide a sublime survey of the medium up to the present. Drawings, packed in like sardines, concentrate on the period 1880 to 1945, with installations in coming months to focus on more recent eras. Photographs, skewed to the present, demonstrate how diverse that medium has become. And design is divided between two spaces, one a dense hodgepodge of objects, new and old, including chairs, pitchers, posters and automobiles, the other a mix of architectural models and drawings. With its stress on everyday objects, the design collection represents the core philosophy of the museum as it evolved in its early days: to extend modernism into the lives of ordinary people. As a 1949 museum Bulletin put it, ''Modern art is an intrinsic part of modern living.'' The new Modern, adopted already into the hearts and minds of New Yorkers, is itself the best proof how true that is. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. KIMMELMAN 'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Aveune, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK * 'PERSONAL AFFECTS: POWER AND POETICS IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN ART,' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700) and St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 111th Street, through Jan. 3 and Dec. 5, respectively. This two-part exhibition traces what its curators call a ''post-identity'' development in South African art since the end of apartheid, with issues of class, race and gender subsumed under other personal or abstract concerns. For the occasion, the museum commissioned new pieces from 17 artists, some specifically for the cathedral. The installation there is more than just effective. It's the strongest group show of new art anywhere in the city so far this season. But certain artists are seen to better advantage in the smaller-scale spaces of the Museum of African art itself. All in all, the show's two halves are forcefully complementary. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+. COTTER * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: see above. KIMMELMAN 'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, through Feb. 6. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens citizen for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+. COTTER 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10. SMITH Galleries: Uptown BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead. KEN JOHNSON ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points. GLUECK * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism. SMITH A. R. PENCK: 'CONSTRUCTIONS,' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Dec. 18. Mr. Penck's primitivistic paintings featuring stick figures and pictographic signs became internationally visible during the triumph of German Neo-Expressionism in the 1980's. This exhibition features something different: compact, slapdash constructions mostly from the early 70's made of found objects and materials like bottles, cardboard boxes, wire, fabric, tape and newspaper. Displayed on a single table that almost fills the gallery, they create a vaguely comical theater of the absurd. JOHNSON * 'PICASSO-BECKMANN/BECKMANN-PICASSO,' Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 31. This wonderfully illuminating exhibition brings together two great 20th-century artists who are not ordinarily closely associated. It includes significant as well as interesting minor works by both. Picasso's colorful, thickly painted late-30's picture of a bull goring a horse is worth a visit all by itself, and so is Beckmann's ''Soldier's Dream'' from 1942, a darkly comical allegory of lust and death with bird-man and bird-woman lovers. JOHNSON 'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Sol\u00f3rzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jos\u00e9 D\u00e1vila. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 4 . This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON CARMEN CICERO, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660, through Dec. 14. Mr. Cicero's cartoonish, easel-size narrative paintings combine humor, gothic mystery and Magritte-style surrealism. In some, men in trenchcoats and fedoras walk through landscapes of dreamlike desolation or drive old cars on nocturnal country roads; in others emblematic images like a knight's helmet or a locomotive hover like mystical signs. Mr. Cicero is not an Outsider -- he has been exhibiting his art since the early 50's and earned a M.F.A. degree in 1991 -- but his work has the hair-raising feeling of a self-taught visionary's. JOHNSON GEORGE GROSZ: 'NEW YORK DRAWINGS,' Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190, through Dec. 4. This fascinating exhibition presents a series of ink drawings made to illustrate a 1941 collection of writings by the journalist Ben Hecht called ''1001 Afternoons in New York.'' Grosz, who moved to New York in 1933, may have done his best work during his Weimar years, but this show of never-before-exhibited drawings shows he did not leave behind his extraordinarily prehensile draftsmanship or his incisively satiric imagination. JOHNSON * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown. COTTER Galleries: Chelsea SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet-to-be-published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog. JOHNSON RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies. JOHNSON CILDO MEIRELES: 'DESCALA' AND 'STRICTU,' Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Dec. 4. Concerned with changing the spectator's role from passive to active, Mr. Meireles, a Brazilian environmental artist, offers a heavy-breathing account of how spaces can be used to control mind and body. On a wooden interrogation table in a dark room is a statement condemning societal authoritarianism. The viewer is invited to don handcuffs attached to a ball and chain while viewing the second work: flat ladders and runged poles line the walls of a smaller gallery, creating a handsome compositional surround, Mondrianlike in its reductive effect. GLUECK BEATRIZ MILHAZES: 'SUMMERTIME,' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Dec. 4. This Rio de Janeiro-based painter continues to produce large abstractions that teeter on the divide between the expressive and the decorative. Ms. Milhaze layers radiating blossoms, target patterns, stripes, hearts, butterflies and peace signs onto gridded patchworks of rich color. With their sensuously textured, gold leaf-accented surfaces and neo-hippie exuberance the paintings promise but don't quite deliver something really over the top. JOHNSON Other Galleries * 'AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY: 1945-1980 [DEBATING MODERNISM],' Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, (718) 631-6396, through Jan. 13. Recently reopened after a two-year renovation, this gallery is being promoted as a showplace, and justly so: it looks spiffy and its opening show is an ambitous one that rethinks canonical accounts of American modernism. Gold-standard artists like Pollock are joined by less successful contemporaries, and Photo Realism, a movement until recently out of favor, is reconsidered. Is the show cohesive? No, but it's stimulating and fun, with some terrific underknown works by familiar artists. COTTER IAN HAMILTON FINLAY, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 52nd Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 3. Mr. Finlay, a Scottish poet, artist, gardener and rebel, born in 1925, aches for the past and feels its impact on the present. His graphic works are inspired by the French Revolution, classical art and literature, boats, World War II and his renowned garden. An expert typographer, he often fashions images from words or combinations of letters alone, placing them in punchy arrangements. Best are his images of ships, which occasionally take wry turns. Type fanciers and concrete poetry buffs will have a picnic; others may want to take along a cryptograph to fathom his buried meanings. GLUECK 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER 'JAMAICA FLUX: WORKSPACES AND WINDOWS,' Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718) 658-7400, through Jan. 8. Although some of the work in this ambitious show is in the gallery, much is embedded in the surrounding environment, a major shopping strip. A local branch of North Fork Bank yields sculptures on the themes of wealth and illusions. Street posters adapt corporate marketing strategies to ecourage the use of libraries. The collective called Center for Urban Pedagogy planted models for urban architecture among footwear displays in Sneaker Mart Plus, and the artist Liselot van der Heijden's places a pointedly edited version of George W. Bush's 2004 State of the Union address in a shop among tapes of speeches by Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. COTTER ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting. JOHNSON SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.
