There are the darting eyes, at once crystalline and unreadable, and the pillowy mouth that alternately seduces and punishes. Most of all there is that nose, a great squashed appendage that sits on the actor's long face like a threat and a dare, and on which you can almost see the traces of violently thrown balls and fists. It's a face that's initially difficult to reconcile with the priestly white collar and black cassock that complete the portrait. Yet the priest easily belongs in the gallery of Melvillian men of honor and respect, the Resistance fighters, yes, but also the gangsters and the detectives who pursue them. This strange, often thrilling, always surprising film -- ''L\u00e9on Morin, Priest'' in English -- was Melville's sixth feature and almost the exact midpoint between early successes like ''Bob le Flambeur'' (1956), about a gentleman thief organizing the heist of a lifetime, and ''Army of Shadows'' (1969), his late-career masterpiece about the Resistance. Given his interest in the war, it's understandable that he was drawn to ''L\u00e9on Morin'' and its story of life during the occupation. (It's only now receiving an American theatrical release.) The revelation is that resistance here is located in the push and pull between a Roman Catholic priest and one of his female parishioners.", "headline": {"main": "A French Resistance of Another Sort", "kicker": "Movie Review | 'L\u00e9on Morin, Priest'"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1017, "_id": "4fd28a948eb7c8105d85d362", "snippet": "\u201cL\u00e9on Morin, Priest\u201d involves the push and pull between a Roman Catholic priest and one of his female parishioners.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/movies/17leon.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2009/04/17/arts/17leon-75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2009/04/17/arts/17leon-75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2009/04/17/arts/17leon-600.jpg", "height": 357, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2009/04/17/arts/17leon-600.jpg", "xlargeheight": 357}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MELVILLE, JEAN-PIERRE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BELMONDO, JEAN-PAUL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRIESTS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Manohla", "lastname": "DARGIS"}], "original": "By MANOHLA DARGIS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-04-17T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Movies; Arts"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 39}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.

An eccentric worthy of Werner Herzog, Mr. Strel was born to swim, at least on camera: he's a bobbing, at times foundering star attraction. ''Big River Man'' tracks Mr. Strel's improbable 2007 conquest of the Amazon, which began in Peru on Feb. 1 and ended 66 event-and-parasite-filled days later in Brazil on April 7. For more than two months Mr. Strel, then 53, and his retinue -- along with the director John Maringouin -- churned through 3,274 miles of river on an adventure that crossed national and psychological borders and often seemed downright absurd if not entirely pointless. Mr. Strel liked to say he was swimming the Amazon in order to protect the rain forest, even if, as his son, Borut, freely says mid-excursion, ''No one knew exactly what the hell he meant by that.'' But as the self-help books say, it's the journey that's important, not the destination.

Both films are deeply engaged in the social and economic realities of the Great Depression, which, if anything, makes them timelier today. In ''City Lights'' Chaplin is a citizen of the streets who goes from sleeping in the arms of a civic statue to fighting back his impossible love for a blind flower girl. ''Modern Times'' imagines him almost literally as a cog in the gigantic machine of American capitalism, a factory worker who befriends an orphan (Paulette Goddard) and dreams of the open road.
