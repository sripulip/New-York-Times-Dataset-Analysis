(The great anthropologist Franz Boas defined his field as ''the biological history of mankind in all its varieties.'') Others scoff at such pretensions. In their view, anthropology is an applied branch of the humanities, an intellectual apprenticeship in the delicate art of getting to know other cultures without flattening them to the contours of your own. That these disparate approaches have managed to cohabit a single discipline for more than a century, the pendulum of fashion swinging judiciously between them, is that rare miracle, a successful marriage of convenience. Lately, though, one senses a growing interest in divorce.

Armed only with accounts at A.O.L. and E*Trade, the kid had bought stock and then, ''using multiple fictitious names,'' posted hundreds of messages on Yahoo Finance message boards recommending that stock to others. He had done this 11 times between September 1999 and February 2000, the S.E.C. said, each time triggering chaos in the stock market. The average daily trading volume of the small companies he dealt in was about 60,000 shares; on the days he posted his messages, volume soared to more than a million shares. More to the point, he had made money. Between September 1999 and February 2000, his smallest one-day gain was $12,000. His biggest was $74,000. Now the kid had agreed to hand over his illicit gains, plus interest, which came to $285,000. When I first read the newspaper reports last fall, I didn't understand them. It wasn't just that I didn't understand what the kid had done wrong; I didn't understand what he had done. And if the initial articles about Jonathan Lebed raised questions -- what did it mean to use a fictitious name on the Internet, where every name is fictitious, and who were these people who traded stocks na\u00efvely based on what they read on the Internet? -- they were trivial next to the questions raised a few days later when a reporter asked Jonathan Lebed's lawyer if the S.E.C. had taken all of the profits. They hadn't. There had been many more than the 11 trades described in the S.E.C's press release, the lawyer said. The kid's take from six months of trading had been nearly $800,000.

Boas himself made seminal contributions to all four fields but foresaw a time when anthropology would split apart on its subdisciplinary fault lines; even in 1904 he discerned that there were ''indications of its breaking up.''

I exit onto a roughly-paved road and arrive at a small white guardhouse near a wooden sign: ''Hobet 21.'' It doesn't look like much. But in fact Hobet 21 covers some 12,000 acres, almost all of it hidden from easy public view by foliage and mountain ridges. Hobet 21 is owned by Arch Coal, America's second-largest coal company, with mines throughout Appalachia and the West. Arch will dig up 100 million tons of coal this year, with six million coming from Hobet 21. Almost half the coal Arch digs in Appalachia will be obtained by a controversial method known as ''mountaintop removal.'' Instead of digging the coal out of the mountains in subterranean shafts, as miners used to do, workers today -- with the help of enormous machines called draglines that scoop 100 tons of earth and rock at a time -- simply remove the mountains from the coal.

Compact disc sellers and buyers alike face the problem of accessibility. Stores cannot display everything available and buyers cannot find what they want. Classical sales may amount to only 3 percent of the market, but consider Amazon .com, with an excellent search engine and very broad availability. Amazon has reported that classical music makes up 18 percent of its music sales. Mr. Tommasini, and I, may enjoy some of the music on Albany's CD's issued in editions of only 200 copies, but those and others like them are part of a major problem. Discs like these are heavily subsidized by performers and composers who want their music published. Companies who issue such discs like to publish as many as they can because their profit is guaranteed by the subsidies; sales are almost irrelevant. In the book business, such vanity press issues are kept out of stores and find whatever market they can through direct sales. But in the clas sical music market, many of these discs are offered for sale as though they might be commercially viable, perhaps because many of them do have artistic merit. Nevertheless, they clog the marketplace, making business more difficult for labels like mine, and the majors, who depend on selling compact discs for their income. LESLIE GERBER Saugerties, N.Y.
